 text: 2 Atomic and Nuclear Physics A knowledge of atomic and nuclear physics is essential to the nuclear engineer because these subjects form the scientific foundation on which the nuclear engi­neering profession is based. The relevant parts of atomic and nuclear physics are reviewed in this chapter and the next. 2.1 FUNDAMENTAL PARTICLES The physical world is composed of combinations of various subatomic or funda­mental particles. A number of fundamental particles have been discovered. This led to the discovery that these fundamental particles are in tum made up of quarks bound together by gluons. In current theory, particles of interest to the nuclear engineer may be divided into leptons and hadrons. The electron, positron, and neutrino are leptons. Hadrons of interest are the proton and neutron, which belong to a subclass of hadrons called baryons. The leptons are subject to the weak nuclear forces, whereas hadrons and baryons in particular experience both the weak and strong nuclear forces. It is the hadrons that are composed of quarks, and it is the exchange of gluons between collections of quarks that is responsible for the strong nuclear force. 5

 text: 6 Atomic and Nuclear Physics Photon e Photon Figure 2.1 The annihilation of a negatron and positron with the release of two photons. Chap. 2 For the understanding of nuclear reactors and the reactions of interest to their operation, it is only important to consider a class of these particles and not explore their structure. Of these, only the following are important in nuclear engineering. 1 Electron The electron has a rest-mass2 me = 9.10954 X 10-31 Kg3 and carries a charge e = 1.60219 x 10-19 coulombs. There are two types of electrons: one carrying a negative charge -e, the other carrying a positive charge +e. Except for the difference in the sign of their charge, these two particles are identical. The negative electrons, or negatrons as they are sometimes called, are the nonnal elec­trons encountered in this world. Positive electrons, or positrons, are relatively rare. When, under the proper circumstances, a positron collides with a negatron, the two electrons disappear and two (and occasionally more) photons (particles of elec­tromagnetic radiation) are emitted as shown in Fig. 2.1. This process is known as electron annihilation, and the photons that appear are called annihilation radiation. Proton This particle has a rest mass m p = 1.67265 x 10-27 Kg and carries a positive charge equal in magnitude to the charge on the electron. Protons with negative charge have also been discovered, but these particles are of no importance in nuclear engineering. I A discussion of quark theory may be found in several of the particle physics references at the end of this chapter. 2 According to the theory of relativity, the mass of a particle is a function of its speed relative to the observer. In giving the masses of the fundamental particles, it is necessary to specify that the particle is at rest with respect to the observer-hence, the term rest mass. 3 A discussion of units, their symbols, and abbreviati ons, together with tables of conversion factors, are found in Appendix I at the end of this book. Tabulations of fundamental constants and nuclear data are given in Appendix I.

 text: Sec. 2.2 Atomic and Nuclear Structure 7 Neutron The mass of the neutron is slightly larger than the mass of the proton-namely, mn = 1.67495 x 10-27 Kg, and it is electrically neutral. The neutron is not a stable particle except when it is bound into an atomic nucleus. A free neutron decays to a proton with the emission of a negative electron (t3-decay; see Section 2.8) and an antineutrino, a process that takes, on the average, about 12 minutes. Photon It is a curious fact that all particles in nature behave sometimes like particles and sometimes like waves. Thus, certain phenomena that are normally thought of as being strictly wavelike in character also appear to have an associated corpuscular or particlelike behavior. Electromagnetic waves fall into this category. The particle associated with electromagnetic waves is called the photon. This is a particle with zero rest mass and zero charge, which travels in a vacuum at only one speed-namely, the speed of light, c = 2.9979 X 108 m1sec. Neutrino This is another particle with zero rest mass and no electrical charge that appears in the decay of certain nuclei. There are at least six types of neutrinos, only two of which (called electron neutrinos and electron antineutrinos) are important in the atomic process and are of interest in nuclear engineering. For most purposes, it is not necessary to make a distinction between the two, and they are lumped together as neutrinos. 2.2 ATOMIC AND NUCL EAR STRUCTURE As the reader is doubtless aware, atoms are the building blocks of gross matter as it is seen and felt. The atom, in tum, consists of a small but massive nucleus surrounded by a cloud of rapidly moving (negative) electrons. The nucleus is com­posed of protons and neutrons. The total number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number of the atom and is given the symbol Z. The total electrical charge of the nucleus is therefore +Ze. In a neutral atom, there are as many elec­trons as protons-namely, Z-moving about the nucleus. The electrons are re­sponsible for the chemical behavior of atoms and identify the various chemical el­ements. For example, hydrogen (H) has one electron, helium (He) has two, lithium (Li) has three, and so on. The number of neutrons in a nucleus is known as the neutron number and is denoted by N The total number of nucleons- that is, protons and neutrons in a nucleus-is equal to Z + N = A, where A is called the atomic mass number or nucleon number. The various species of atoms whose nuclei contain particular numbers of pro­tons and neutrons are called nuclides. Each nuclide is denoted by the chemical sym­bol of the element (this specifies Z) with the atomic mass number as superscript

page number: 26
 text: 8 Atomic and Nuclear Physics Chap. 2 (this determines N, since N = A -Z). Thus, the symbol 1 H refers to the nuclide of hydrogen (Z = 1) with a single proton as nucleus; 2H is the hydrogen nuclide with a neutron as well as a proton in the nucleus eH is also called deuterium or heavy hydrogen); 4He is the helium (Z = 2) nuclide whose nucleus consists of two protons and two neutrons; and so on. For greater clarity, Z is sometimes written as a subscript, as in � H, iH, iHe, and so on. Atoms such as 1 Hand 2H, whose nuclei contain the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons (same Z but different N-therefore different A), are known as isotopes. Oxygen, for instance, has three stable isotopes, 160, 170, 180 (Z = 8; N = 8, 9, 10), and five known unstable (i.e., radioactive) isotopes, l30, 140, 150, 190, and 2°0 (Z = 8; N = 5,6,7, 11, 12). The stable isotopes (and a few of the unstable ones) are the atoms that are found in the naturally occurring elements in nature. However, they are not found in equal amounts; some isotopes of a given element are more abundant than oth­ers. For example, 99.8% of naturally occurring oxygen atoms are the isotope 160, .037% are the isotope 170, and .204% are 180. A table of some of the more im­portant isotopes and their abundance is given in Appendix II. It should be noted that isotopic abundances are given in atom percent-that is, the percentages of the atoms of an element that are particular isotopes. Atom percent is often abbreviated as a/o. Example 2.1 A glass of water is known to contain 6.6 x 1024 atoms of hydrogen. How many atoms of deuterium eH) are present? Solution. According to Table 11.2 in Appendix II, the isotopic abundance of 2H is 0.015 a/o. The fraction of the hydrogen, which is 2H, is therefore 1.5 x 10-4 The total number of 2H atoms in the glass is then 1.5 x 10-4 x 6.6 X 1024 = 9.9 X 1020 [Ans.] 2.3 ATOMIC AND MOLECU LAR WEIGHT The atomic weight of an atom is defined as the mass of the neutral atom relative to the mass of a neutral 12C atom on a scale in which the atomic weight of 12C is arbitrarily taken to be precisely 12. In symbols, let meZ) be the mass of the neutral atom denoted by AZ and m(12C) be the mass of neutral12C. Then the atomic weight of AZ, M(AZ), is given by A meZ) M( Z) = 12 X 12 . m( C) (2.1)

 text: Sec. 2.3 Atomic and Molecular Weight 9 Suppose that some atom was precisely twice as heavy as 12C. Then according to Eq. (2.1), this atom would have the atomic weight of 12 x 2 = 24. As noted in Section 2.2, the elements found in nature often consist of a num­ber of isotopes. The atomic weight of the element is then defined as the average atomic weight of the mixture. Thus, if Yi is the isotopic abundance in atom percent of the ith isotope of atomic weight Mi, then the atomic weight of the element is (2.2) The total mass of a molecule relative to the mass of a neutral 12C atom is called the molecular weight. This is merely the sum of the atomic weights of the constituent atoms. For instance, oxygen gas consists of the molecule O2, and its molecular weight is therefore 2 x 15.99938 = 31.99876. Example 2.2 Using the data in the following table, compute the atomic weight of naturally occur­ ring oxygen. Isotope Abundance (a/o) 99.759 0.037 0.204 Solution. From Eq. (2.2), it follows that Atomic weight 15.99492 16.99913 17.99916 M(O) = 0.01[ye60)M(170) + y(I70)M(170) + yesO)MesO)] = 15.99938. [Ans.] It must be emphasized that atomic and molecular weights are unitless num­bers, being ratios of the masses of atoms or molecules. By contrast, the gram atomic weight and gram molecular weight are defined as the amount of a sub­stance having a mass, in grams, equal to the atomic or molecular weight of the substance. This amount of material is also called a mole. Thus, one gram atomic weight or one mole of 12C is exactly 12 g of this isotope, one mole of 02 gas is 31.99876 g, and so on. Since atomic weight is a ratio of atomic masses and a mole is an atomic weight in grams, it follows that the number of atoms or molecules in a mole of any substance is a constant, independent of the nature of the substance. For instance, suppose that a hypothetical nuclide has an atomic weight of 24.0000. It follows that the individual atoms of this substance are exactly twice as massive as 12C.

page number: 28
 text: 10 Atomic and Nuclear Physics Chap. 2 Therefore, there must be the same number of atoms in 24.0000 g of this nuclide as in 12.0000 g of 12C. This state of affairs is known as Avogadro's law, and the number of atoms or molecules in a mole is called Avogadro's number. This number is denoted by NA and is equal to NA = 0.6022045 X 10244 Using Avogadro's number, it is possible to compute the mass of a single atom or molecule. For example, since one gram mole of 12C has a mass of 12 g and contains N A atoms, it follows that the mass of one atom in 12C is m(12C) = 12 = 1.99268 x 1023 g. 0.6022045 X 1024 There is, however, a more natural unit in tenns of which the masses of indi­vidual atoms are usually expressed. This is the atomic mass unit, abbreviated amu, which is defined as one twelfth the mass of the neutral 12C atom, that is Inverting this equation gives Introducing m 12C from the preceding paragraph gives 1 amu = -12 x 1.99268 X 10-23g = I/NA g = 1.66057 X 10-24 g. Also from Eq. (2.1), so that Thus, the mass of any atom in amu is numerically equal to the atomic weight of the atom in question. 40rdinarily a number of this type would be written as 6.0222045 x 1023 However, in nuclear engineering problems, for reasons given in Chap. 3 (Example 3.1), Avogadro's number should always be written as the numerical factor times 1024•

 text: Sec. 2.5 Mass and Energy 11 2.4 ATOMIC AND NUCLEAR RADII The size of an atom is somewhat difficult to define because the atomic electron cloud does not have a well-defined outer edge. Electrons may occasionally move far from the nucleus, while at other times they pass close to the nucleus. A reason­able measure of atomic size is given by the average distance from the nucleus that the outermost electron is to be found. Except for a few of the lightest atoms, these average radii are approximately the same for all atoms-namely, about 2 x la-10m. Since the number of atomic electrons increases with increasing atomic number, it is evident that the average electron density in the electron cloud also increases with atomic number. The nucleus, like the atom, does not have a sharp outer boundary. Its sur­face, too, is diffuse, although somewhat less than that of an atom. Measurements in which neutrons are scattered from nuclei (see Section 3.5) show that to a first approximation the nucleus may be considered to be a sphere with a radius given by the following formula: R = 1.25frn x A 1/3 (2.3) where R is in femtometers (fm) and A is the atomic mass number. One femtometer is 10-l3 centimeters. Since the volume of a sphere is proportional to the cube of the radius, it follows from Eq. (2.3) that the volume V of a nucleus is proportional to A. This also means that the ratio A / V -that is, the number of nucleons per unit volume­is a constant for all nuclei. This uniform density of nuclear matter suggests that nuclei are similar to liquid drops, which also have the same density whether they are large or small. This liquid-drop model of the nucleus accounts for many of the physical properties of nuclei. 2.5 MASS AND ENERGY One of the striking results of Einstein's theory of relativity is that mass and energy are equivalent and convertible, one to the other. In particular, the complete anni­hilation of a particle or other body of rest mass rno releases an amount of energy, Eresb which is given by Einstein's famous formula (2.4) where c is the speed of light. For example, the annihilation of 1 g of matter would lead to a release of E = 1 x (2.9979 X 1010)2 = 8.9874 x 1020ergs = 8.9874 x 1013 JOUles. This is a substantial amount of energy, which in more common units is equal to about 25 million kilowatt-hours.

page number: 30
 text: 12 Atomic and Nuclear Ph ysics Chap. 2 Another unit of energy that is often used in nuclear engineering is the electron volt, denoted by eV. This is defined as the increase in the kinetic energy of an electron when it falls through an electrical potential of one volt. This, in tum, is equal to the charge of the electron multiplied by the potential drop-that is, 1 eV = 1.60219 x 10-19 coulomb x 1 volt = 1.60219 x 10-19 joule. Other energy units frequently encountered are the Me V (106 e V) and the ke V (103 eV). Example 2.3 Calculate the rest-mass energy of the electron in MeV. Solution. From Eq. (2.4), the rest-mass energy of the electron is mec2 = 9.1095 x 10-28 x (2.9979 X 1010)2 = 8.1871 X 10-7 ergs = 8.1871 x 10-14 JOUle. Expressed in Me V this is 8.1871 X 10-14 joule -;-1.6022 x 10-13 joule/MeV = 0.5110 MeV. [Ans.] Example 2.4 Compute the energy equivalent of the atomic mass unit. Solution. This can most easily be computed using the result of the previous example. Thus, since according to Section 2.3, 1 amu = 1.6606 x 10-24g, it follows that 1 amu is equivalent to 1.6606 x 10-24 g/amu --------:-:28=----- X 0.5110 MeV/electron = 931.5 MeV. [Ans.] 9.1095 x 10-g/electron When a body is in motion, its mass increases relative to an observer at rest according to the formula (2.5) where rna is its rest mass and v is its speed. From Eq. (2.5), it is seen that rn reduces to rna as v goes to zero. However, as v approaches c, rn increases without limit. The total energy of a particle, that is, its rest-mass energy plus its kinetic energy, is given by (2.6)

page number: 31
 text: Sec. 2.5 Mass and Energy 13 where m is as given in Eq. (2.5). Finally, the kinetic energy E is the difference between the total energy and the rest-mass energy. That is, 2 [1 ] = moc -1 J1 -v2jc2 (2.7) (2.8) The radical in the first term in Eq. (2.8) can be expanded in powers of (vjc)2 using the binomial theorem. When v « c, the series may be truncated after the first term. The resulting expression for E is (2.9) which is the familiar formula for kinetic energy in classical mechanics. It should be noted that Eq. (2.9) may be used instead of Eq. (2.8) only when the kinetic energy computed from Eq. (2.9) is small compared with the rest-mass energy. That is, Eq. (2.9) is valid provided (2.10) As a practical matter, Eq. (2.9) is usually accurate enough for most purposes pro­vided v ::: 0.2c or E ::: 0.02Erest• (2.11) According to Example 2.3, the rest-mass energy of an electron is 0.511 MeV. From Eq. (2.11), it follows that the relativistic formula Eq. (2.8) must be used for elec­trons with kinetic energies greater than about 0.02 x 0.511 MeV= 0.010 MeV= 10 ke V. Since many of the electrons encountered in nuclear engineering have kinetic energies greater than this, it is often necessary to use Eq. (2.8) for electrons. By contrast, the rest mass of the neutron is almost 1,000 MeV and 0.02 Erest = 20 MeV. In practice, neutrons rarely have kinetic energies in excess of 20 MeV. It is permissible, therefore, in all nuclear engineering problems to calculate the kinetic energy of neutrons from Eq. (2.9). When the neutron mass is inserted into Eq. (2.9), the following handy formula is obtained: v = 1.383 x 106JE, (2.12) where v is in cm/sec and E is the kinetic energy of the neutron in e V. It is important to recognize that Eqs. (2.8) and (2.9) are valid only for particles with nonzero rest mass; for example, they do not apply to photons. (It should be understood that photons have no rest-mass energy, and it is not proper to use the

page number: 32
 text: 14 Atomic and Nuclear Phy sics Chap. 2 term kinetic energy in referring to such particles.) Photons only travel at the speed of light, and their total energy is given by quite a different formula-namely, E = hv, (2.13) where h is Planck's constant and v is the frequency of the electromagnetic wave associated with the photon. Planck's constant has units of energy x time; if E is to be expressed in eV, h is equal to 4.136 x 10-15 eV-sec. 2.6 PARTICLE WAVELENGTHS It was pointed out in Section 2.1 that all of the particles in nature have an associated wavelength. The wavelength A associated with a particle having momentum p is h A= -, (2.14) P where h is again Planck's constant. For particles of nonzero rest mass, p is given by p=mv, (2.15) where m is the mass of the particle and v is its speed. At nonrelativistic energies, p can be written as p = J2moE, where E is the kinetic energy. When this expression is introduced into Eq. (2.14), the particle wavelength becomes h A = . -J2moE (2.16) This formula is valid for the neutrons encountered in nuclear engineering. Intro­ducing the value of the neutron mass gives the following expression for the neutron wavelength: 2.860 X 10-9 A= ------JE (2.17) where A is in centimeters and E is the kinetic energy of the neutron in e V. For the relativistic case, it is convenient to compute p directly by solving the relativistic equations in the preceding section. This gives 1 / 2 2 P = -V Etotal - Erest' c (2.18)

 text: Sec. 2.7 and so Excited States and Radiation hc A = ---;::::::====== = .J Etotal -Erest 15 (2.19) The momentum of a particle of zero rest mass is not given by Eq. (2.15), but rather by the expression E p=-, c (2.20) in which E is the energy of the particle. When Eq. (2.20) is inserted into Eq. (2.14), the result is hc A-­-E· (2.21) Introducing numerical values for hand c in the appropriate units gives finally 1.240 x 10-6 A= ----­E (2.22) where A is in meters and E is in e V. Equation (2.22) is valid for photons and all other particles of zero rest mass. 2.7 EXCITED STATES AND RADIATION The Z atomic electrons that cluster about the nucleus move in more or less well­defined orbits. However, some of these electrons are more tightly bound in the atom than others. For example, only 7.38 e V is required to remove the outermost electron from a lead atom (Z = 82), whereas 88 ke V (88,000 e V) is required to remove the innermost or K-electron. The process of removing an electron from an atom is called ionization, and the energies 7.38 e V and 88 ke V are known as the ionization energies for the electrons in question. In a neutral atom, it is possible for the electrons to be in a variety of different orbits or states. The state of lowest energy is the one in which an atom is normally found, and this is called the ground state. When the atom possesses more energy than its ground state energy, it is said to be in an excited state or an energy level. The ground state and the various excited states can conveniently be depicted by an energy-level diagram, like the one shown in Fig. 2.2 for hydrogen. The highest energy state corresponds to the situation in which the electron has been completely removed from the atom and the atom is ionized. An atom cannot remain in an excited state indefinitely; it eventually decays to one or another of the states at lower energy, and in this way the atom eventually returns to the ground state. When such a transition occurs, a photon is emitted by

 text: 16 Atomic and Nuclear Physics 13.58-���� 12.07 10.19 o Figure 2.2 The energy levels of the hydrogen atom (not to scale). Chap. 2 the atom with an energy equal to the difference in the energies of the two states. For example, when a hydrogen atom in the first excited state at 10.19 eV (see Fig. 2.2) decays to the ground state, a photon with an energy of 10.19 e V is emitted. From Eq. (2.22), this photon has a wavelength of ).. = 1.240 X 10-6/10.19 = 1.217 x 10-7 m. Radiation of this wavelength lies in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Example 2.5 A high-energy electron strikes a lead atom and ejects one of the K -electrons from the atom. What wavelength radiation is emitted when an outer electron drops into the vacancy? Solution. The ionization energy of the K -electron is 88 ke V, and so the atom minus this electron is actually in an excited state 88 ke V above the ground state. When the outer electron drops into the K position, the resulting atom still lacks an electron, but now this is an outer, weakly bound electron. In its final state, therefore, the atom is excited by only 7.38 eV, much less than its initial 88 keY. Thus, the photon in this transition is emitted with an energy of slightly less than 88 keY. The corresponding wavelength is A = 1.240 X 10-6/8.8 X 104 = 1.409 x 10-"m. [Ans.] Such a photon is in the x-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum. This process, the ejection of an inner, tightly bound electron, followed by the transition of another electron, is one way in which x-rays are produced. The nucleons in nuclei, like the electrons in atoms, can also be thought of as moving about in various orbits, although these are not as well defined and under-

In any case, there is a state of lowest energy, the ground state; except for the very lightest nuclei, all nuclei have excited states as well. These states are shown in Fig. 2.3 for l2C. A comparison of Figs. 2.2 and 2.3 shows that the energies of the excited states and the energies between states are considerably greater for nuclei than for atoms. Although this conclusion is based only on the 24 t etc 22 20 18 16 14 > Il.) :E :>. 12 rf c:: U.l 10 8 6 4 2 Figure 2.3 The energy levels of 0 carbon 12.

 text: 18 Atomic and Nuclear Physics Chap. 2 states of hydrogen and 12C, it is found to be true in general. This is due to the fact that the nuclear forces acting between nucleons are much stronger than the electrostatic forces acting between electrons and the nucleus. Nuclei in excited states may decay to a lower lying state, as do atoms, by emitting a photon with an energy equal to the difference between the energies of the initial and final states. The energies of photons emitted in this way from a nucleus are usually much greater than the energies of photons originating in electronic transitions, and such photons are called y-rays. A nucleus in an excited state can also lose its excitation energy by internal conversion. In this process, the excitation energy of the nucleus is transferred into kinetic energy of one of the innennost atomic electrons. The electron is then ejected from the atom with an energy equal to that of the nuclear transition less the ioniza­tion energy of the electron. Internal conversion thus competes with y-ray emission in the decay of nuclear-excited states. The hole remaining in the electron cloud after the departure of the electron in internal conversion is later filled by one of the outer atomic electrons. This transi­tion is accompanied either by the emission of an x -ray or the ejection of another electron in a process similar to internal conversion. Electrons originating in this way are called Auger electrons. 2.8 NUCLEAR STABILITY AND RADIOACTIVE DECAY Figure 2.4 shows a plot of the known nuclides as a function of their atomic and neutron numbers. On a larger scale, with sufficient space provided to tabulate data for each nuclide, Fig. 2.4 is known as a Segre chart or the chart a/the nuclides. The figure depicts that there are more neutrons than protons in nuclides with Z greater than about 20, that is, for atoms beyond calcium in the periodic table. These extra neutrons are necessary for the stability of the heavier nuclei. The excess neutrons act somewhat like nuclear glue, holding the nucleus together by compensating for the repulsive electrical forces between the positively charged protons. It is clear from Fig. 2.4 that only certain combinations of neutrons and pro­tons lead to stable nuclei. Although generally there are several nuclides with the same atomic number but different neutron numbers (these are the isotopes of the element), if there are either too many or too few neutrons for a given number of pro­tons, the resulting nucleus is not stable and it undergoes radioactive decay. Thus, as noted in Section 2.2, the isotopes of oxygen (A = 8) with N = 8,9, and 10 are stable, but the isotopes with N = 5, 6, 7, 11, and 12 are radioactive. In the case of the isotopes with N = 5, 6, and 7, there are not enough neutrons for stability, whereas the isotopes with N = 11 and 12 have too many neutrons. Nuclei such as 150, which are lacking in neutrons, undergo f3+ -decay. In this process, one of the protons in the nucleus is transfonned into a neutron, and a

(Based on S. E. Liverhant, Elementary Introduction to Nuclear Reactor Physics. New York: Wiley, 1960.) positron and a neutrino are emitted. The number of protons is thus reduced from 8 to 7 so that the resulting nucleus is an isotope of nitrogen, 15N, which is stable. This transformation is written as 150 � 15N+ v, where fJ+ signifies the emitted positron, which in this context is called a fJ-ray and v denotes the neutrino. By contrast, nuclei like 190, which are excessively neutron­rich, decay by fJ-decay, emitting a negative electron and an antineutrino: 190 � 19F+v, where v stands for the antineutrino. In this case, a neutron changes into a proton and the atomic number increases by one unit. It should be noted that in both fJ+­decay and fJ --decay the atomic mass number remains the same. In both forms of fJ-decay, the emitted electrons appear with a continuous en­ergy spectrum like that shown in Fig. 2.5. The ordinate in the figure, N(E), is equal to the number of electrons emitted per unit energy, which have a kinetic energy E.

It should be noted in the figure that there is a definite maxi­mum energy, Emax, above which no electrons are observed. It has been shown that the average energy of the electrons E is approximately equal to O.3Emax in the case of f3--decay. In f3+ -decay, E ::: O.4Emax. Frequently, the daughter nucleus, the nucleus formed in f3-decay, is also un­stable and undergoes f3-decay. This leads to decay chains like the following: A nucleus which is lacking in neutrons can also increase its neutron number by electron capture. In this process, an atomic electron interacts with one of the protons in the nucleus, and a neutron is fonned of the union. This leaves a vacancy in the electron cloud which is later filled by another electron, which in tum leads to the emission of y-rays, which are necessarily characteristic of the daughter element or the emission of an Auger electron. Usually the electron that is captured by the nucleus is the innennost or K -electron, and so this mode of decay is also called K-capture. Since the daughter nucleus produced in electron capture is the same as the nucleus fonned in f3--decay, these two decay processes often compete with one another. Another way by which unstable nuclei undergo radioactive decay is by the emission of an a-particle. This particle is the highly stable nucleus of the isotope 4He, consisting of two protons and two neutrons. The emission of an a-particle reduces the atomic number by two and the mass number by four. Thus, for instance, the a-decay of ��8U (uranium-238) leads to �64Th (thorium-234) according to the equation 238U �234 Th +4 He 92 90 2·

In marked contrast to ,8-decay, a-particles are emitted in a discrete (line) energy spectrum similar to photon line spectra from excited atoms. This is shown in Table 2.1, where data is given for the four groups of a-particles observed in the decay of 226Ra (Radium-226). The nucleus fonned as the result of ,8-decay (+ or -), electron capture, or a-decay is often left in an excited state following the transfonnation. The excited (daughter) nucleus usually decays5 by the emission of one or more y-rays in the manner explained in Section 2.7. An example of a situation of this kind is shown in Fig. 2.6 for decay of 60Co-a nuclide widely used in nuclear engineering. A diagram like that shown in the figure is known as a decay scheme. It should be especially noted that the major y -rays are emitted by the daughter nucleus, in this case 6oNi, although they are frequently attributed to (and arise as the result of) the decay of the parent nucleus, 60Co. Most nuclei in excited states decay by the emission of y-rays in an immea­surably short time after these states are fonned. However, owing to peculiarities in their internal structure, the decay of certain excited states is delayed to a point where the nuclei in these states appear to be semistable. Such long-lived states are called isomeric states of the nuclei in question. The decay by y-ray emission of one of these states is called an isomeric transition and is indicated as IT in nuclear data tabulations. In some cases, isomeric states may also undergo ,8-decay. Figure 2.6 shows the isomeric state found at 58 ke V above the ground state of 60Co. As a rule, isometric states occur at energies very close to the ground state. This state is fonned from the ,8--decay of 60Pe, not shown in the figure. It is observed that this isomeric state decays in two ways: either to the ground state of 60Co or by ,8--decay to the first two excited states of 6oNi. Of these two decay modes, the first is by far the more probable (> 99%) and occurs largely by internal conversion. SStrictly speaking, the tenn decay should not be used to describe the emission of y-rays from nuclei in excited states since only the energy and not the character of the nucleus changes in the process. More properly, y-ray emission should be referred to as nuclear dependent-excit ation, not decay. However, the use of the tenn decay is well established in the literature.

Chap. 2 In summary, a nucleus without the necessary numbers of protons and neutrons for stability will decay by the emission of a-rays or f3-rays or undergo electron capture, all of which may be accompanied by the subsequent emission of y-rays. It must be emphasized that radioactive nuclei ordinarily do not decay by emitting neutrons or protons. 2.9 RADIOACTIVITY CALCU LATIONS Calculations of the decay of radioactive nuclei are relatively straightforward, owing to the fact that there is only one fundamental law governing all decay processes. This law states that the probability per unit time that a nucleus will decay is a constant independent of time. This constant is called the decay constant and is denoted by A.6 Consider the decay of a sample of radioactive material. If at time t there are net) atoms that as yet have not decayed, An(t) dt of these will decay, on the average, in the time interval d t between t and t + d t. The rate at which atoms decay in the sample is therefore An (t) disintegrations per unit time. This decay 6By tradition, the same symbol, A, is used for both decay constant and the wavelength defined earlier, as well as for mean free path, defined later. Because of their very different uses, no confusion should arise.

 text: Sec. 2.9 Radioactivity Calculations 23 rate is called the activity of the sample and is denoted by the symbol a. Thus, the activity at time t is given by aCt) = An(t). (2.23) Activity has traditionally been measured in units of curies, where one curie, denoted as Ci, is defined as exactly 3.7 x 1010 disintegrations per second. Units to describe small activities are the millicurie, 10-3 curie, abbreviated as mCi, the microcurie, 10-6 curie, denoted by tLCi, and the picocurie, 10-12 curie, which is written as pCi. The SI unit of activity is the becquerel, Bq, which is equal to exactly one disintegration per second. One Bq = 2.703 x 10-11 Ci :::: 27 pCi. Since An (t) d t nuclei decay in the time interval d t , it follows that the decrease in the number of undecayed nuclei in the sample in the time dt is -dn(t) = An(t) dt. This equation can be integrated to give n(t) = noe->..t (2.24) where no is the number of atoms at t = O. Multiplying both sides of Eq. (2.24) by A gives the activity of the sample at time t-namely, (2.25) where ao is the activity at t = O. The activity thus decreases exponentially with time. The time during which the activity falls by a factor of two is known as the half-life and is given the symbol T1/2• Introducing this definition into Eq. (2.25) gives Then taking the logarithm of both sides of this equation and solving for TI/2 gives In2 0.693 TI/2 = T = -A-' Solving Eq. (2.26) for A and substituting into Eq. (2.25) gives aCt) = aoe-O.693tITI/2 (2.26) (2.27) This equation is often easier to use in computations of radioactive decay than Eq. (2.25), especially with the advent of pocket-size electronic calculators and spread

 text: 24 Atomic and Nuclear Physics Chap. 2 sheet programs, because half-lives are more widely tabulated than decay constants. Equation (2.27) eliminates the need to compute A. It is not difficult to show that the average life expectancy or mean-life, t, of a radioactive nucleus is related to the decay constant by the formula t = I/A. From Eq. (2.25), it can be seen that in one mean-life the activity falls to l/e of its initial value. In view of Eq. (2.26), the mean-life and half-life are related by -TI/2 t = 0.693 = 1.44Tl/2. (2.28) The exponential decay of a radioactive sample is shown in Fig. 2.7, where the half-life and mean-life are also indicated. It is frequently necessary to consider problems in which radioactive nuclides are produced in a nuclear reactor or in the target chamber of an accelerator. Let it be assumed for simplicity that the nuclide is produced at the constant rate of R atoms/sec. As soon as it is formed, of course, a radioactive atom may decay. The change in the number of atoms of the nuclide in the time dt is given by a simple rate equation the time rate of change of the nuclide = or symbolically c :E � a.J2 a.Je the rate of production -the rate of loss T1/2 t Time (afbitfary units) Figure 2.7 The decay of a radioactive sample.

This equation can be integrated with the result R n = noe-M + -(1 -e-A.t), A (2.29) where no is again the number of radioactive atoms present at t = O. Multiplying this equation through by A gives the activity of the nuclide (2.30) If ao = 0, then, according to this result, a increases steadily from zero and as t ---+ 00, a approaches the maximum value amax = R. Similarly, n approaches a constant value nmax given by RIA. If ao =F 0, then the activity due to decay of the atoms originally present is added to the activity of the newly produced nuclide. In both cases, the activity approaches the value amax = R as t ---+ 00. Example 2.6 Gold-198 (T1/2 = 64.8 hr) can be produced by bombarding stable 197 Au with neu­ trons in a nuclear reactor. Suppose that a 197 Au foil weighing 0.1 g is placed in a certain reactor for 12 hrs and that its activity is 0.90 Ci when removed. (a) What is the theoretical maximum activity due to 198 Au in the foil? (b) How long does it take for the activity to reach 80 percent of the maximum? Solution 1. The value of R in Eq. (2.30) can be found from the data at 12 hrs. From Eq. (2.26), A = 0.693/64.8 = 1.07 x 10-2 hr-1 Then substituting into Eq. (2.30) gives or from Eq. (2.26) 0.90 = R[1 _ e-O.693xI2/64.8]. Solving either of these equations yields R = 7.5 Ci. (To get R in atoms/sec, which is not required in this problem, it is merely necessary to mUltiply the prior value of R by 3.7 x 1010.) According to the previous discussion, the theoretical maximum activity is also 7.5 Ci. [Ans.] 2. The time to reach 80% of O!max can also be found from Eq. (2.30): 0.8R = R(1 -eA.t). Solving for t gives t = 150 hrs. [Ans.]

 text: 26 Atomic and Nuclear Physics Chap. 2 Another problem that is often encountered is the calculation of the activity of the radioactive nuclide B in the decay chain, A ---+ B ---+ C ---+ It is clear that an atom of B is formed with each decay of an atom of A. We can write a simple rate equation for this behavior. the time rate of change of B = the rate of production, from A -the rate of decay of B to C. Since AAnA is the rate atoms of A decay into atoms of B, the rate atoms of B are produced is AAnA. The rate of decay of B atoms is ABnB, so the rate of change of B, dnB/ dt is, dnB --= -ABnB + AAnA. dt Substituting Eq. (2.24) for nA gives the following differential equation for nB: dnB -AAt --= -ABnB + AAnAOe dt where nAO is the number of atoms of A at t = O. Integrating Eq. (2.31) gives -ABt + nAoAA (-nB = nBOe e AB - AA In tenns of activity, this equation may be written as -ABt + aAoAB (-AM -ABt) aB = aBOe e -e , AB - AA (2.31) (2.32) (2.33) where aAO and aBO are the initial activities of A and B, respectively. Generalizations of Eq. (2.33) for computing the activity of the nth nuclide in a long decay chain have been derived and are found in the references at the end of the chapter. 2.10 NUCLEAR REACTIONS A nuclear reaction is said to have taken place when two nuclear particles-two nuclei or a nucleus and a nucleon-interact to produce two or more nuclear particles or y-rays. If the initial nuclei are denoted by a and b, and the product nuclei and/or y-rays (for simplicity it is assumed that there are only two) are denoted by c and d, the reaction can be represented by the equation a+b ---+c+d. (2.34)

 text: Sec. 2.10 Nuclear Reactions 27 The detailed theoretical treatment of nuclear reactions is beyond the scope of this book. For present purposes, it is sufficient to note four of the fundamental laws governing these reactions: 1. Conservation of nucleons. The total number of nucleons before and after a reaction are the same. 2. Conservation of charge. The sum of the charges on all the particles before and after a reaction are the same. 3. Conservation of momentum. The total momentum of the interacting particles before and after a reaction are the same. 4. Conservation of energy. Energy, including rest-mass energy, is conserved in nuclear reactions. It is important to note that, as we see, conservation of nucleons and conser­vation of charge do not imply conservation of protons and neutrons separately. The principle of the conservation of energy can be used to predict whether a certain reaction is energetically possible. Consider, for example, a reaction of the type given in Eq. (2.34). The total energy before the reaction is the sum of the kinetic energies of the particles a and b plus the rest-mass energy of each particle. Similarly, the energy after the reaction is the sum of the kinetic energies of particles c and d plus their rest-mass energies. By conservation of energy it follows that (2.35) where Ea, Eb, and so on, are the kinetic energies of particles a, b, etc. Equation (2.35) can be rearranged in the form (2.36) Since the quantities on the left-hand side represents the kinetic energy of the par­ticles, it is evident that the change in the kinetic energies of the particles before and after the reaction is equal to the difference in the rest-mass energies of the particles before and after the reaction. The right-hand side of Eq. (2.36) is known as the Q-value of the reaction; that is, (2.37) In all computations and tabulations, Q is always expressed in MeV. Recalling that 1 amu is approximately 931 Mev, we can write the Q value as (2.38)

page number: 46
 text: 28 Atomic and Nuclear Physics Chap. 2 From Eq. (2.36), it is clear that when Q is positive there is a net increase in the kinetic energies of the particles. Such reactions are called exothermic. When Q is negative there is a net decrease in the energies of the particles, and the reaction is said to be endothermic. Since in exothennic reactions there is a net decrease in mass, nuclear mass is converted into kinetic energy, while in endothennic reactions there is a net increase, thus kinetic energy is converted into mass. Equation (2.37) gives Q in tenns of the masses of the nuclei a, b, and so on. However, the Q value can also be in tenns of the masses of the neutral atoms containing these nuclei. Thus, in view of the conservation of charge, (2.39) where Za, Zb, and so on, are the atomic numbers of a, b, and so on, and Eq. (2.37) can be put in the fonn Q = {[(Ma + Zame) + (Mb + Zbme)] -[(Me + Zeme) + (Md + Zdme)]}931 Mev, (2.40) where me is the electron rest mass in amu. But Ma + Zame is equal to the mass of the neutral atom of a, Mb + Zbme is the mass of the atom of b, and so on. It follows that Eq. (2.37) is a valid fonnula for Q, where Ma, Mb, and so on, are interpreted as the masses (in amu) of the neutral atoms in question, although the actual nuclear reaction involves only the atomic nuclei. It is fortunate that Q can be computed from neutral atomic mass data since the masses of most bare nuclei are not accurately known. Incidentally, in the usual experimental arrangement, one of the particles, say a, is at rest in some sort of target, and the particle b is projected against the target. In this case, Eq. (2.34) is often written in the abbreviated fonn a(b, c)d or a(b, d)c, whichever is the more appropriate. For example, when oxygen is bombarded by energetic neutrons, one of the reactions that occurs is 160 + n ---+16 N + IH. In abbreviated fonn, this is

 text: Sec. 2.11 Binding Energy 29 where the symbols nand p refer to the incident neutron and emergent proton, re­spectively. Example 2.7 Complete the following reaction: 14N + n ---+? + IH. Solution. The atomic number of 14N is 7, that of the neutron is O. The sum of the atomic numbers on the left-hand side of the reaction is therefore 7, and the sum on the right must also be 7. Since Z = 1 for hydrogen, it follows that Z of the unknown nuclide is 7 -1 = 6 (carbon). The total number of nucleons on the left is the sum of the atomic mass numbers-namely, 14 + 1 = 15. Since the mass number of IH is 1, the carbon isotope fonned in this reaction must be 14C. Thus, the reaction is Example 2.8 One of the reactions that occurs when 3H (tritium) is bombarded by deuterons eH nuclei) is where d refers to the bombarding deuteron. Compute the Q value of this reaction. Solution. The Q value is obtained from the following neutral atomic masses (in amu): MeH) = 3.016049 MeH) = 2.014102 M(4He) = 4.002604 M(n) = 1.008665 M(4He) + M(n) = 5.011269 Thus, from Eq. (2.37), the Q value in amu is Q = 5.030151-5.011269 = 0.018882 amu. Since 1 amu = 931.502 MeV (see Ex. 2.4), Q = 0.018882x931.502 = 17.588 Me V, which is positive and so this reaction is exothennic. This means, for instance, that when stationary 3H atoms are bombarded by I-MeV deuterons, the sum of the kinetic energies of the emergent a-particle (4He) and neutron is 17.588 + 1 = 18.588 MeV. 2.11 BINDING ENERGY When a low-energy neutron and a proton combine to form a deuteron, the nucleus of2H, a 2.23-MeV y-ray, is emitted and the deuteron recoils slightly with an energy of about 1.3 ke V. The reaction in question is

page number: 48
 text: 30 Atomic and Nuclear Physics Chap. 2 p+n �d+y, or, in terms of the neutral atoms, IH+n �2 H+ y. Since the y-ray escapes from the site of the reaction, leaving the deuteron behind, it follows from the conservation of energy that the mass of the deuteron in energy units is approximately 2.23 Me V less than the sum of the masses of the neutron and proton. This difference in mass between the deuteron and its constituent nucleons is called the mass defect of the deuteron. In a similar way, the masses of all nuclei are somewhat smaller than the sum of the masses of the neutrons and protons contained in them. This mass defect for an arbitrary nucleus is the difference (2.41) where MA is the mass of the nucleus. Equation (2.41) can also be written as (2.42) where me is the mass of an electron. The quantity M p + me is equal to the mass of neutral 1 H, while M A + Zme is equal to the mass M of the neutral atom. The mass defect of the nucleus is therefore (2.43) which shows that � can be computed from the tabulated masses of neutral atoms. Equations (2.41) and (2.43) are not precisely equivalent owing to slight differences in electronic energies, but this is not important for most purposes. When � is expressed in energy units, it is equal to the energy that is neces­sary to break the nuleus into its constituent nucleons. This energy is known as the binding energy of the system since it represents the energy with which the nucleus is held together. However, when a nucleus is produced from A nucleons, � is equal to the energy released in the process. Thus, in the case of the deuteron, the binding energy is 2.23 MeV. This is the energy released when the deuteron is formed, and it is also the energy required to split the deuteron into a neutron and proton. The total binding energy of nuclei is an increasing function of the atomic mass number A. However, it does not increase at a constant rate. This can be seen most conveniently by plotting the average binding energy per nucleon, �/ A, versus A, as shown in Fig. 2.8. It is noted that there are a number of deviations from the curve at low A, while above A = 50 the curve is a smooth but decreasing function of A. This behavior of the binding energy curve is important in determining possible sources of nuclear energy.

However, when such nuclei are fonned from their constituent nucleons, a relatively large amount of energy is released. By con­trast, nuclei with low binding energy per nucleon can be more easily disrupted and they release less energy when fonned. The Q value of a nuclear reaction can be expressed in tenns of the binding energies of the reacting particles or nuclei. Consider the reaction given by Eq. (2.34). From Eq. (2.43), the binding energy of a, in units of mass, is BE(a) = ZaMeH) + NaMn -Ma. The mass of a can then be written as Similarly,

page number: 50
 text: 32 Atomic and Nuclear Physics Chap. 2 and so on. Substituting these expressions for Ma, Mb, and so on, into Eq. (2.37) and noting that gives Za + Zb = Zc + Zd Na + Nb = Nc + Nd, Q = [BE(c) + BE(d)] -[BE(a) -BE(b)]. Here, the c2 has been dropped because Q and the binding energies all have units of energy. This equation shows that Q is positive-that is, the reaction is exothennic­when the total binding energy of the product nuclei is greater than the binding energy of the initial nuclei. Put another way, whenever it is possible to produce a more stable configuration by combining two less stable nuclei, energy is released in the process. Such reactions are possible with a great many pairs of nuclides. For instance, when two deuterons, each with a binding energy of 2.23 MeV, react to fonn 3H, having a total binding energy of 8.48 Me V, according to the equation 22H ---+ 3H + 1 H, (2.44) there is a net gain in the binding energy of the system of 8.48 -2 x 2.23 = 4.02 MeV. In this case, the energy appears as kinetic energy of the product nuclei 3H and IH. Reactions such as Eq. (2.44), in which at least one heavier, more stable nu­cleus is produced from two lighter, less stable nuclei, are known as fusion reac­ tions. Reactions of this type are responsible for the enonnous release of energy in hydrogen bombs and may some day provide a significant source of thennonuclear power. In the regions of large A in Fig. 2.8, it is seen that a more stable configura­tion is fonned when a heavy nucleus splits into two parts. The binding energy per nucleon in 238U, for instance, is about 7.5 MeV, whereas it is about 8.4 MeV in the neighborhood of A = 238/2 = 119. Thus, if a uranium nucleus divides into two lighter nuclei, each with about half the uranium mass, there is a gain in the binding energy of the system of approximately 0.9 MeV per nucleon, which amounts to a total energy release of about 238 x 0.9 = 214 MeV. This process is called nuclear fission, and is the source of energy in nuclear reactors. It must be emphasized that the binding energy per nucleon shown in Fig. 2.8 is an average overall of the nucleons in the nucleus and does not refer to anyone nucleon. Occasionally it is necessary to know the binding energy of a particular nucleon in the nucleus-that is, the amount of energy required to extract the nu­cleon from the nucleus. This binding energy is also called the separation energy and is entirely analogous to the ionization energy of an electron in an atom. Con-

 text: Sec. 2.12 Nuclear Models 33 sider the separation energy Es of the least bound neutron-sometimes called the last neutron-in the nucleus AZ. Since the neutron is bound in the nucleus, it fol­lows that the mass of the nucleus (and the neutral atom) AZ is less than the sum of the masses of the neutron and the residual nucleus A-I Z by an amount, in energy Mev, equal to Es. In symbols, this is Es = [Mn + M(A-l Z) -M(AZ)]931 Mev/amu. (2.45) The energy Es is just sufficient to remove a neutron from the nucleus without providing it with any kinetic energy. However, if this procedure is reversed and a neutron with no kinetic energy is absorbed by the nucleus A-I Z, the energy Es is released in the process. Example 2.9 Calculate the binding energy of the last neutron in l3C. Solution. If the neutron is removed from l3C, the residual nucleus is l2C. The bind­ ing energy or separation energy is then computed from Eq. (2.45) as follows: Met2C) = 12.00000 Mn = 1.00866 Mn + Met2C) = 13.00866 -M(l3C) = 13.00335 Es = 0.00531 amu x 931 Mev = 4.95 MeV [Ans.] Before leaving the discussion of nuclear binding energy, it should be noted that nuclei containing 2, 6, 8, 14, 20, 28, 50, 82, or 126 neutrons or protons are especially stable. These nuclei are said to be magic, and their associated numbers of nucleons are known as magic numbers. These correspond to the numbers of neutrons or protons that are required to fill shells (or subshells) of nucleons in the nucleus in much the same way that electron shells are filled in atoms. The existence of magic nuclei has a number of practical consequences in nu­clear engineering. For instance, nuclei with a magic neutron number absorb neu­trons to only a very small extent, and materials of this type can be used where neutron absorption must be avoided. For example, Zirconium, whose most abun­dant isotope contains 50 neutr ons, has been widely used as a structural material in reactors for this reason. 2.12 NUCLEAR MODEL S Two models of the nucleus are useful in explaining the various phenomena ob­served in nuclear physics-the shell model and the liquid drop model. Although

page number: 52
 text: 34 Atomic and Nuclear Physics Chap. 2 neither of these models can completely explain the observed behavior of nuclei, they do provide valuable insight into the nuclear structure and cause many of the nuclear reactions of interest to the nuclear engineer. Shell Model The shell model may be thought of as the nuclear analogue to the many electron atom. In this model, the collective interaction of the nucleons in the nucleus gener­ate a potential well. One can then think of a single nucleon as if it is moving in the well created by the average effect of the other nucleons. As in the case of other such potential wells, such a well can have one or more quantized states. These states are then populated in the same way that the atomic orbitals of an atom are populated by electrons. Just as in the atom, there is a maximum number of nucleons that may occupy a shell. When this number is reached, a closed shell results. Although a detailed discussion of this model is beyond the scope of this text, a few remarks are necessary to understand the stability of certain nuclei and the origin of the magic numbers. The neutrons and protons fill each level in a potential well according to the Pauli exclusion principle. Accounting for the angular mo­mentum for each state, there are 2j + 1 possible substates for each level with total angular momentum j. Since we are dealing with two sets of identical particles-neutrons on the one hand and protons on the other-there are really two such wells, one for each. They differ by the coulomb interaction of the protons. The levels are then filled according to the exclusion principle. The differing m j values will split apart in energy because of the spin orbit interaction. As in the case of the many electron atoms, this may result in reordering of the levels and development of wider gaps in between the energy levels than otherwise would be expected. Since the neutron and proton wells can each have closed shells, the nuclei can be extremely stable when both wells have closed shells and less so when neither do. This phenomenon gives rise to the magic numbers discussed earlier. Liquid Drop Model From Section 2.11, the binding energy is the mass defect expressed in energy units. The liquid-drop model of the nucleus seeks to explain the mass defect in tenns of a balance between the forces binding the nucleons in the nucleus and the coulombic repulsion between the protons. The nucleus may be thought of as a drop of nuclear liquid. Just as a water droplet experiences a number of forces acting to hold it together, so does the nu­clear droplet. To a first approximation, the mass of a nuclear droplet is just the mass of the components-the neutrons and protons. These are interacting in the nucleus and are bound by the nuclear forces. The binding of each nucleon to its neighbors

page number: 53
 text: Sec. 2.12 Nuclear Models 35 means that energy and mass must be added to tear the nucleus apart. The mass may then be approximated by: M = NMn + ZMp -aA. (2.46) Equation 2.46 overestimates the effect of the bonds between the nucleons since those near the surface cannot have the same number of bonds as those deep inside the nucleus. To correct for this, a surface correction term must be added: (2.47) where T denotes the surface tension. Since the radius R of the nucleus is proportional to A 1/3, we can rewrite this term: M = NMn + ZMp -aA + fJA2/3 (2.48) The coulombic repulsion tends to increase the energy and hence mass of the nucleus. Using the potential energy associated with the repulsive force, the expression becomes: (2.49) There are additional, strictly nuclear effects that must be accounted for in the mass equation. These account for a preference for the nucleons to pair together and for the effect of the Pauli exclusion principle.7 In the shell model, the nucleons were thought of as filling two potential wells. The lowest energy system would then be one in which the number of protons would equal the number of neutrons since, in this case, the wells would be filled to the same height, with each level filled according to the Pauli exclusion principle. The nucleus having N = Z should then be more stable than the nucleus with N # Z. To account for this effect, a correction term must be added to the mass equation: (2.50) Finally, if one examines the stable nuclides, one finds a preference for nuclei with even numbers of neutrons and protons. The preference reflects that, experimen­tally, the bond between two neutrons or two protons is stronger than that between a neutron and proton. Nuclei with odd numbers of neutrons and odd numbers of protons would thus be less strongly bound together. When either Z or N is odd and the other even, one would expect the binding to be somewhere in between these two cases. To account for this effect, a pairing term denoted by 8 is added to the expression: 7For a discussion of the Pauli exclusion principle, see references on modem physics.

 text: 36 Atomic and Nuclear Physics Chap. 2 The term 8 is 0 if either N or Z is odd and the other even, positive if both are odd, and negative if both are even. Equation 2.51 is the mass equation. The coefficients for the mass equation are obtained by fitting the expression to the known nuclei. When this is done, the semi-empirical mass equation is obtained. The values for each of the coefficients are typically taken as: Mass of neutron Mass of proton a {3 y � 8 939.573 MeV 938.280 MeV 15.56 MeV 17.23 MeV 0.697 MeV 23.285 MeV 12.0 MeV The formula can accurately predict the nuclear masses of many nuclides with Z > 20. The ability to predict these masses suggests that there is some truth to the way the liquid-drop models the interactions of the nucleons in the nucleus. For atomic masses, the mass of a hydrogen atom (938.791 MeV) may be sub­stituted for the mass of the proton to account for the mass of the atomic electrons. Example 2.10 Calculate the mass and binding energy of !�7 Ag using the mass equation. Solution. The mass equation may be used to calculate the binding energy by noting that the negative of the sum of the last five terms represents the binding energy of the constituent nucleons. The atomic mass of the !�7 Ag is first obtained by using the mass formula and noting that N is even and Z is odd. The term involving 8 is thus taken as zero.

 text: Sec. 2.13 Gases, Liquids, and Solids 37 2.13 GASES, LIQUIDS, AND SOLIDS Before concluding this review of atomic and nuclear physics, it is appropriate to consider the nature of gross physical matter since this is the material encountered in all practical problems. Classically, there are three so-called states of matter: gas, liquid, and solid. The principal characteristics of these are as follows. Gases The noble gases-helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon -and most metallic vapors are monatomic-that is, they are composed of more or less freely moving, independent atoms. Virtually all other gases consist of equally freely moving diatomic or polyatomic molecules. The random, disordered motion of these particles is one of the characteristic features of all gases. Solids Most of the solids used in nuclear systems-namely, metals and ceramics-are crystalline solids. Such solids are composed of large numbers of microcrystals, each of which consists of an ordered three-dimensional array or lat­tice of atoms. Each microcrystal contains an enormous number of individual atoms. Since the regUlarity in the arrangement of the atoms in the lattice extends over so many atoms (often over the entire microcrystal), such crystals are said to exhibit long-range order. There are a number of other materials that are called solids be­cause they are rigid bodies, that do not exhibit long-range order. Examples of such materials are plastics, organic materials, glasses, and various amorphous solids. Liquids The microscopic structure of liquids is considerably more com­plicated than is usually assumed. The atoms and/or molecules in a liquid interact strongly with one another; as a result, they tend to be ordered as they are in a crys­tal, but not over such long distances. The ordered arrangement breaks down, so to speak, over long distances. For this reason, liquids are said to exhibit short-range order. The Maxwellian Distribution In a gas, the energies of the atoms or molecules are distributed according to the Maxwellian distribution function. If N (E) is the density of particles per unit en­ergy, then N(E) dE is the number of particles per unit volume having energies between E and E + dE. According to the Maxwellian distribution, N (E) is given by the formula (2.52)

page number: 56
 text: 38 Atomic and Nuclear Physics Chap. 2 In Eq. (2.52), N is the total number of particles per unit volume; that is, the particle density; k is Boltzmann's constant, which has units of energy per degree Kelvin: k = 1.3806 X 10-23 joule/o K = 8.6170 x 10-5eV/o K; and T is the absolute temperature of the gas in degrees Kelvin. The function N (E) is plotted in Fig. 2.9. For solids and liquids, the energy distribution functions are more complicated than the one given in Eq. (2.52). However, it has been shown that, to a first approx­imation, N (E) for solids and liquids can also be represented by Eq. (2.52), but the parameter T differs somewhat from the actual temperature of the substance. The difference is small for temperatures above about 300° K. At these temperatures, it can often be assumed that Eq. (2.52) applies to solids, liquids, and gases. The most probable energy in a distribution such as the one given in Eq. (2.52) is defined as the energy corresponding to the maximum of the curve. This can be calculated by placing the derivative of N(E) equal to zero. The most probable energy, E P' in a Maxwellian energy distribution is then easily found to be Ep = �kT However, the average energy, E, is defined by the integral 1 100 E = -N(E)E dE.

 text: Sec. 2.13 Gases, Liquids, and Solids Substituting Eq. (2.52) into Eq. (2.54) and carrying out the integration gives -3 E = 2kT 39 (2.55) The combination of parameters kT in Eqs. (2.53) and (2.55) often appears in the equations of nuclear engineering. Calculations involving these parameters are then expedited by remembering that, for To = 293.61°K, kT has the value kTo = 0.0253 eV :::: to eV (2.56) Example 2.11 What are the most probable and average energies of air molecules in a New York City subway in summertime at, say, 38°C (about 100°F)? Solution. It is first necessary to compute the temperature in degrees Kelvin. From the formula OK = °C + 273.15, it follows that the temperature of the air is 311.15°K. Then using Eqs. (2.53) and (2.55) gives 1 311.15 Ep = "2 x 0.0253 x 293.61 = 0.0134 eY. [Ans.] Finally, E = 3Ep, so that E = 0.0402 eY. [Ans.] The Gas Law To a first approximation, gases obey the familiar ideal gas law (2.57) where P is the gas pressure, V is the volume, n M is the number of moles of gas contained in V, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. Equation (2.57) can also be written as where N A is Avogadro's number. Since there are N A atoms per mole, it follows that there are n M N A atoms in V The first factor is therefore equal to N -the total number of atoms or molecules per unit volume. At the same time, the factor Rj N A is the definition of k, Boltzmann's constant. The ideal gas law can thus be put in the convenient form P = NkT. (2.58)

 text: 40 Atomic and Nuclear Physics Chap. 2 From Eq. (2.58) it is seen that gas pressure can be (and, in certain applications, is) expressed in units of energy per unit volume. 2.14 ATOM DENSITY In nuclear engineering problems, it is often necessary to calculate the number of atoms or molecules contained in 1 cm3 of a substance. Consider first a material such as sodium, which is composed of only one type of atom. Then if p is its physical density in g/cm3 and M is its gram atomic weight, it follows that there are p / M gram moles of the substance in 1 cm3 Since each gram mole contains N A atoms, where N A is Avogadro's number, the atom density N, in atoms per cm3, is simply Example 2.12 pNA N=­M The density of sodium is 0.97 g/cm3 Calculate its atom density. Solution. The atomic weight of sodium is 22.990. Then from Eq. (2.59), 0.97 x 0.6022 x 1024 24 N = 22.990 = 0.0254 x 10 [Ans.] (It is usual to express the atom densities as a factor times 1024.) (2.59) Equation (2.59) also applies to substances composed of individual molecules, except that N is the molecule density (molecules per cm3) and M is the gram molecular weight. To find the number of atoms of a particular type per cm3, it is merely necessary to multiply the molecular density by the number, ni, of those atoms present in the molecule, (2.60) The computation of atom density for crystalline solids such as NaCI and for liquids is just as easy as for simple atomic and molecular substances, but the ex­planation is more complicated. The problem here is that there are no recogniz­able molecules-an entire microcrystal of NaCI is, so to speak, a molecule. What should be done in this case is to assume that the material consists of hypothet­ical molecules containing appropriate numbers of the constituent atoms. (These molecules are in fact unit cells of the crystalline solid and contain the appropriate

 text: Sec. 2.14 Atom Density 41 number of atoms.) Then by using the molecular weight for this pseudomolecule in Eq. (2.59), the computed value of N gives the molecular density of this molecule. The atom densities can then be computed from this number in the usual way as illustrated in the following example. Example 2.13 The density of a NaCI crystal is 2.17 g/cm3 Compute the atom densities of Na and Cl. Solution. The atomic weight of Na and CI are 22.990 and 35.453, respectively. The molecular weight for a pseudomolecule of NaCI is therefore 58.443. Using Eq. (2.59) gives 2.17 x 0.6022 x 1024 N = = 0.0224 X 1024 molecules/cm 3 58.443 Since there is one atom each of Na and CI per molecule, it follows that this is also equal to the atom density of each atom. [Ans.] Frequently it is required to compute the number of atoms of a particular iso­tope per cm3 Since, as pointed out in Section 2.2, the abundance of isotopes is always stated in atom percent, the atom density of an isotope is just the total atom density of the element as derived earlier, multiplied by the isotopic abundance ex­pressed as a fraction. Thus, the atom density Ni for the ith isotope is N. _ YipNA I -100M' (2.61) where Yi is the isotopic abundance in atam percent, abbreviated a/a. The chemical compositions of mixtures of elements such as metallic alloys are usually given in terms of the percent by weight of the various constituents. If p is the physical density of the mixture, then the average density of the i th component is (2.62) where Wi is the weight percent, abbreviated W / a, of the component. From Eq. (2.59), it follows that the atom density of this component is (2.63) where Mi is its gram atomic weight.

page number: 60
 text: 42 Atomic and Nuclear Physics Chap. 2 With a substance whose composition is specified by a chemical fonnula, the percent by weight of a particular element is equal to the ratio of its atomic weight in the compound to the total molecular weight of the compound. Thus, with the compound XmYn, the molecular weight is mMx + nMy, where Mx and My are the atomic weights of X and Y, respectively, and the percent by weight of the element X is mMx wjo(X) = x 100. mMx +nMy (2.64) In some nuclear applications, the isotopic composition of an element must be changed by artificial means. For instance, the uranium used as fuel in many nuclear reactors must be enriched in the isotope 235U (the enrichment process is discussed in Chap. 4). In this case, it is also the practice to specify enrichment in weight percent. The atomic weight of the enriched uranium can be computed as follows. The total number of uranium atoms per cm3 is given by N=LNi, where Ni is the atom density of the ith isotope. Introducing N from Eq. (2.59) and Ni from Eq. (2.63) gives 1 1 Wi -=-L­ M 100 Mi (2.65) The application of this fonnula in computations involving enriched uranium is illustrated in Example 2.16. Example 2.14 For water of normal (unit) density compute: (a) the number of H20 molecules per cm3, (b) the atom densities of hydrogen and oxygen, (e) the atom density of 2H. Solution 1. The molecular weight of H20 is 2 x 1.00797 + 15.9994 molecular density is therefore, 18.0153. The 1 x 0.6022 X 1024 N(H20) = 18.0153 = 0.03343 x 1024 molecules/cm 3. [Ans.]

 text: Sec. 2.14 Atom Density 43 2. There are two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen per H 20 molecule. Thus, the atom density of hydrogen N(R) = 2 x 0.03343 X 1024 = 0.06686 X 1024 atoms/cm3, and N(O) = 0.03343 X 1024 atoms/cm3 [Ans.] 3. The relative abundance of 2H is 0.015 alo so that NeH) = 1.5 x 10-4 x N(H) = 1.0029 x 10-5 x 1024 atoms/cm3 [Ans.] Example 2.15 A certain nuclear reactor is fueled with 1,500 kg of uranium rods enriched to 20 wi 0 235V. The remainder is 238V. The density of the uranium is 19.1 g/cm3 (a) How much 235V is in the reactor? (b) What are the atom densities of 235V and 238V in the rods? Solution 1. Enrichment to 20 wi 0 means that 20% of the total uranium mass is 235 V. The amount of 235V is therefore 0.20 x 1500 = 300kg. [Ans.] 2. The atomic weights of 235V and 238V are 235.0439 and 238.0508, respectively. From Eq. (2.63), 235 20 x 19.1 x 0.6022 x 1024 N( V) -100 x 235.0439 = 9.79 x 10-3 x 1024atoms/cm3 [Ans.] The 238V is present to the extent of 80 wi 0, and so Example 2.16 238 80 x 19.1 x 0.6022 x 1024 N( V) -100 x 238.0508 = 3.86 x 10-2 x 1024atoms/cm3 [Ans.] The fuel for a reactor consists of pellets of uranium dioxide (V02), which have a density of 10.5 g/cm3 If the uranium is enriched to 30 wlo in 235V, what is the atom density of the 235V in the fuel? Solution. It is first necessary to compute the atomic weight of the uranium. From Eq. (2.65), 1 1 (30 70) M = 100 235.0439 + 238.0508 '

 text: 44 Atomic and Nuclear Physics Chap. 2 which gives M = 237.141. The molecular weight of the V02 is then 237.141 + 2 x 15.999 = 269.139. In view of Eq. (2.64), the percent by weight of uranium in the V02 is (237.141/269.139) x 100 = 88.1 w/o. The average density of the uranium is therefore 0.881 x 10.5 = 9.25 g/cm3, and the density of 235V is 0.30 x 9.25 = 2.78 g/cm3 The atom density of 235V is finally REFERE NCES General 235 2.78 x 0.6022 x 1024 N( U) -235.0439 =7.11 x 10-3 x 1024atoms/cm3 [Ans.] Arya, A.
