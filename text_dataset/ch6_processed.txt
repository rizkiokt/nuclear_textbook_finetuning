 text: 6 Nuclear Reactor Theory In a critical reactor, as explained in Section 4.1, there is a balance between the number of neutrons produced in fission and the number lost, either by absorption in the reactor or by leaking from its surface. One of the central problems in the design of a reactor is the calculation of the size and composition of the system required to maintain this balance. This problem is the subject of the present Chapter. Calculations of the conditions necessary for criticality are normally carried out using the group-diff usion method introduced at the end of the last Chapter. It is reasonable to begin the present discussion with a one-group calculation. Although this type of calculation is most appropriate for fast reactors, it is shown later in the Chapter that the one-group method can also be used in a modified form for computations of some thermal reactors. 6.1 ONE-GR OUP REACTOR EQUATION Consider a critical fast reactor containing a homogeneous mixture of fuel and coolant. It is assumed that the reactor consists of only one region and has neither a blanket nor a reflector. Such a system is said to be a bare reactor. 266

 text: Sec. 6.1 One-Group Reactor Equation 267 This reactor is described in a one-group calculation by the one-group time­ dependent diffusion equation (see Eq. [5.17]) DV2¢ -2.a¢ + s = _ � a¢ . v at (6.1) Here ¢ is the one-group flux, D and 2.a are the one-group diff usion coefficient and macroscopic absorption cross-section for the fuel-coolant mixture, s is the source density (i.e., the number of neutrons emitted per cm3 /sec), and v the neutron speed. Note, we are making no assumptions as to the state of the reactor so that there may be time dependence involved. If this were not the case, then there would be no time derivative term, and a balance between the source and the absorption and leakage would exist. Nominal constants and one-group cross-sections for a fast reactor are given in Table 6.1. In a reactor at a measurable power, the source neutrons are emitted in fission. To determine s, let L f be the fission cross-section for the fuel. If there are v neutrons produced per fission, then the source is Here we are assuming that there is no nonfission source of neutrons present in the reactor-a good approximation for a reactor except at very low power levels. If the fission source does not balance the leakage and absorption terms, then the right-hand side of Eq. (6.1) is nonzero. To balance the equation, we multiply the source term by a constant 1/ k, where k an unknown constant. If the source is too small, then k is less than 1. If it is too large, then k is greater than 1.

 text: 268 Nuclear Reactor Theory Chap. 6 The equation may be rewritten as an eigenvalue equation by letting 2 1 (1 ) B = D k�f -�a where B2 is defined as the geometric buckling. Then Eq. (6.2) may be written as (6.3) Finally, this expression for the leakage term may be substituted into Eq. (6.2) and the diffusion equation rewritten as or 2 1 -DB ¢ - �a¢ + -v�f¢ = 0 k (6.4) (6.5) This important result is known as the one-group reactor equation. The one-group equation may be solved for the constant k: k = v�f¢ = v�f DB2¢ + �a¢ DB2 + �a' (6.6) Note that this equation does not give a value for k since B2 is still unknown. Physically, Eq. (6.6) may be interpreted as follows. The numerator is the num­ber of neutrons that are born in fission in the current generation, whereas the de­nominator represents those that were lost from the previous generation. Since all neutrons in a generation are either absorbed or leak from the reactor, then the nu­merator must also equal the number born in the previous generation. But this is the definition of the multiplication factor from Section 4.1 for a finite reactor. We may now define the multiplication factor for a reactor as the birth rate, v � f¢' divided by the leakage rate plus the absorption rate, D B2¢ + �a¢, of the neutrons. The source term in the one-group equation may be written in terms of the fuel absorption cross-section using the following. Let �aF be the one-group absorption cross-section of the fuel, and let YJ be the average number of fission neutrons emit­ted per neutron absorbed in the fuel. 1 The source term is then given by, (6.7) 1 If the fuel consists of more than one species of fissile nuclide or a mixture of fissile and fissionable nuclides, then 11 should be computed as in Section 3.7 using Eq. (3.55).

 text: Sec. 6.1 One-Group Reactor Equation 269 This may also be written as, (6.8) where (6.9) is called the fuel utilization. Since �a is the cross-section for the mixture of fuel and coolant, whereas �aF is the cross-section of the fuel only, it follows that f is equal to the fraction of the neutrons absorbed in the reactor that are absorbed by the fuel. The source tenn in Eq. (6.8) can also be written in tenns of the multiplica tion factor for an infinite reactor. For this purpose, consider an infinite reactor having the same composition as the bare reactor under discussion. With such a reactor, there can be no escape of neutrons as there is from the surface of a bare reactor. All neutrons eventually are absorbed, either in the fuel or the coolant. Furthennore, the neutron flux must be a constant, independent of position. The number of fissions in one generation is simply related to the number of neutrons born in one generation by v, the number of neutrons produced per fission. Since all neutrons born must eventually be absorbed in the system, this must be equal to �a¢, the number of neutrons absorbed per cm3/sec everywhere in the system. Of these neutrons, the number f�a¢ are absorbed in fuel and release 17f�a¢ fission neutrons in the next generation. The number of neutrons born in this new generation can again be re­ lated to the fission rate by v. Sooner or later, all of these neutrons must in tum be absorbed in the reactor. Thus, the absorption of �a ¢ neutrons in one generation leads to the absorption of 17f�a¢ in the next. Now according to the discussion in Section 4.1, the multiplica tion factor is defined as the number of fissions in one generation divided by the number in the preceding generation. Since in an infinite medium these are related to the absorption rate, it follows that, (6.10) where the SUbscript on koo signifies that this result is only valid for the infinite reactor.

(6.9), 1 is 1 = �aF = �aF �a �aF + �aS' Chap. 6 where �aF and �aS are the macroscopic absorption cross-sections of the uranium and sodium, respectively. Dividing numerator and denominator by �aF gives 1 1 = 1 + �aS/�aF = 1 + Nsaas/ NF -aaF' where NF and Ns are the atom densities of the uranium and sodium. Next let PF and Ps be the number of grams of uranium and sodium per cm3 in the mixture. Then Ns Ps MF NF = PF Ms' where MF and Ms are the gram atomic weights of uranium and sodium. Since lw/o of the mixture is fuel, this means that, or PF = 0.01 PF + Ps Ps = 99. PF Using the values of aa given in Table 6.1, the value of 1 is given by and The value of koo is -I 235 0.0008 1 = 1 + 99 x 23 x 1.65 = 1.49 1 = 0.671.[Ans.] koo = 1]1 = 2.2 x 0.671 = 1.48. Since this is greater than unity, an infinite reactor with this composition would be supercritical. [Ans.] Since 1] and f are constants that only depend on the material properties of the reactor, the value of koo is the same for a bare reactor as for an infinite reactor of the same composition. The source term in Eq. (6.8) can therefore be written as, (6.11) Introducing Eq. (6.11) and Eq. (6.3) into the one-group reactor equation, Eq. (6.4) gives,

(6.16) must be solved subject to the boundary condition that ¢ vanishes at the extrapolated faces of the slab-that is, at x = a /2 and at x = -a /2 where a = a + 2d. Then the boundary conditions become (6.17) It may also be noted that, because of the symmetry of the problem, there can be no net flow of neutrons at the center of the slab. Since the neutron current density is proportional to the derivative of ¢, this means that d¢ =0 dx (6.18) at x = O. The condition given by Eq. (6.18) is equivalent to requiring that ¢ be an even function-that is, ¢( -x) = ¢(x), (6.19) and has a continuous derivative within the reactor. [In any problem where it is clear that the flux is a well-behaved function, Eq. (6.19) is often easier to apply than Eq. (6.18).] In any case, the general solution to Eq. (6.16) is ¢(x) = A cos Bx + C sin Bx, (6.20) where A and C are constants to be determined. Placing the derivative of Eq. (6.20) equal to zero at x = ° gives immediately C = 0, so that ¢ reduces to ¢(x) = A cos Bx. Next, introducing the boundary condition given by Eq. (6.17) ata/2 or -a/2 (it makes no difference which since the cosine is an even function) gives (6.21) This equation can be satisfied either by taking A = 0, which leads to the trivial solution ¢ (x) = 0, or by requiring that

This, in tum, is satisfied if B assumes any of the values Bn, where nrr Bn =--;:::::;­a 273 (6.22) (6.23) and n is an odd integer, as can readily be seen by direct substitution into Eq. (6.22). The various constants Bn are known as eigenvalues, and the corresponding functions cos Bnx are called eigenfunctions. It can be shown that if the reactor under consideration is not critical, the flux is the sum of all such eigenfunctions, each multiplied by a function that depends on the time. However, if the reactor is critical, all of these functions except the first die out in time, and the flux assumes the steady-state shape of the first eigenfunction or fundamental-namely, ¢(x) = A cos BIx = A cos (rr;) This is the flux in a critical slab reactor. (6.24) The square of the lowest eigenvalue Bf is called the buckling of the reactor. The origin of this term can be seen by solving the equation satisfied by the flux­ namely, for Bf The result is 2 1 d2¢ B --- -I -¢ dx2' (6.25) The right-hand side of this expression is proportional to the curvature of the flux in the reactor, which, in tum, is a measure of the extent to which the flux curves or buckles. Since in the slab reactor Bf = (;)2 (6.26) the buckling decreases as a increases. In the limit, as a becomes infinite, Bf = 0, ¢ is a constant and has no buckle. It should be observed that the value of the constant A in Eq. (6.24), which de­ termines the magnitude of ¢, has not been established in the prior analysis. Mathe­ matically, this is because the reactor equation (Eq. [6.5] or [6.16]) is homogeneous, and ¢ multiplied by any constant is still a solution to the equation. Physically the reason that the value of A has not been established is that the magnitude of the flux

To find an expression for A, it is necessary to make a separate calculation of the reactor power. In particular, there are 1: f¢ (x) fissions per cm3/sec at the point x, where 1: f is the macroscopic fission cross-section. If the recoverable energy is ER joules per fission2 (with a recoverable energy of 200 MeV, ER = 3.2 X 10-11 joules), then the total power per unit area of the slab, in watts/cm2, is jal2 P = ER1: f ¢(x)dx. -a12 (6.27) Note that the integration is carried out over the physical dimensions of the reactor and not to the extrapolated boundary.

Therefore, it is necessary to generalize the results of the preceding section for re­actors of more realistic shapes. This can easily be done for the following reactors: sphere, infinite cylinder, rectangular parallelepiped, and finite cylinder. These re­actors, together with the coordinate systems used to describe them, are shown in Fig. 6.2. It should be noted that each of these reactors is bare; reflected reactors are discussed in Section 6.6. Sphere Consider first a critical spherical reactor of radius R. The flux in this reactor is a function only of r, and the reactor equation is 2In Lamarsh's book on reactor theory, ER, when expressed in joules, was denoted by y.

 text: 276 Nuclear Reactor Theory Chap. 6 By substituting cjJ = w / r into Eq. (6.30) and solving the resulting equation for w as is done in Section 5.6, the general solution to Eq. (6.30) is easily found to be sinBR cos BR cjJ=A +C--r r where A and C are constants. The second tenn becomes infinite when r goes to zero. Since the flux is a physical quantity and must be finite everywhere, C must be placed equal to zero. Thus, cjJ becomes sinBR cjJ = A--r (6.31) The boundary condition cjJ (R) = 0 can be satisfied by taking B to be anyone of the eigenvalues where n is any integer. However, as explained in the preceding section, only the first eigenvalue is relevant for a critical reactor. Thus, with n = 1, the buckling is and the flux becomes sin(rrr / R) cjJ=A . r (6.32) (6.33) The constant A is again detennined by the operating power of the reactor­namely, (6.34) where d V is the differential volume element. In view of the geometry of the prob­lem, d V is given by and Eq. (6.34) becomes dV = 4rrr2 dr P = 4rr ER 'E f laR r2</>(r) dr. Introducing the flux from Eq.

In this reactor, the flux depends only on the distance r from the axis.

Equation (6.36) is a special case of Bessel's equation, d2¢ I d¢ (2 m2) -+ --+ B -- ¢ = 0, dr2 r dr r2 (6.37) in which m is a constant. Since Eq. (6.37) is a second-order differential equation, it has two independent solutions. These are denoted as lm(Br) and Ym(Br) and are called ordinary Bessel functions of the first and second kind, respectively. 3 These functions appear in many engineering and physics problems and are widely tabu­ lated. Comparing Eq. (6.36) with Eq. (6.37) shows that, in the present problem, m is equal to zero. The general solution to the reactor equation can therefore be written as ¢ = Alo(Br) + CYo(Br), where A and C are again constants. The functions lo(x) and Yo(x) are plotted in Fig. 6.3. It is observed that Yo(x) is infinite at x = 0, while 10(0) = 1. Therefore, 3 A short table of Bessel functions is given in Appendix V.

(6.39) As shown in Fig. 6.3, the function Jo(x) is equal to zero at a number of values of x, labeled Xl, X2, , so that JO(xn) = O. This means that Eq. (6.39) is satisfied provided B is anyone of the values which are the eigenvalues of the problem. However, since in a critical reactor only the lowest eigenvalue is important, it follows that the buckling is (6.40) This one-group flux is then '" = AJo C·�5r ) (6.41) The constant A is again detennined by Eq.

The final expression for the flux is then Finite Cylinder 279 (6.42) An interesting flux distribution is obtained for the case of a finite cylinder of height H and radius R.

 text: Sec. 6.3 Other Reactor Shapes 281 Maximum-to-Average Flux and Power The maximum value of the flux, ¢max, in a uniform bare reactor is always found at the center of the reactor. Since the power density is also highest at the center, it is of some interest to compute the ratio of the maximum flux to its average value throughout the reactor. This ratio, which is denoted by Q, is a measure of the overall variation of the flux within a reactor and is an indication of the extent to which the power density at the center of the system exceeds the average power density. Consider the case of a bare spherical reactor. The value of ¢max is obtained by taking the limit of Eq. (6.35) as r goes to zero. Thus, P . sin(nr / R) n P ¢max = hm = ----4 E R L. f R2 r--+O r 4 E R L. f R3 The average value of ¢ is given by <Pav = � f <pdV, (6.44) (6.45) where the integral is carried out over the volume of the sphere.

(6.46) gives, for the particular case of a sphere, ¢max n2 Q = -= - = 3.29. ¢av 3 Values of Q for other geometries are given in Table 6.2. (6.47) For reasons to be discussed in the next two Chapters, it is important that the flux distribution in an actual reactor be as uniform-that is, as flat-as possible. The values of Q in Table 6.2 would be quite unacceptable for a real reactor. How­ ever, it must be borne in mind that these values were derived for bare reactors. In such systems, the flux undergoes large changes from the reactor center to its surface. As is shown in Section 6.6, with reflected reactors, the flux does not fall to low values at the core-reflector interface, and the flux in these reactors (and all power reactors are reflected) is considerably flatter. The flux is made still flatter in

For instance, if the physical properties of the reactor are specified, then the left-hand side of Eq. (6.50) is known and the dimensions of the reactor must be adjusted so that Bf on the right satisfies the equation. However, if the dimensions are specified, then Bf is known and the properties of the reactor must be adjusted so that the left-hand side of the equation is equal to the right. In this way, the critical size or critical mass of fuel may be detennined. An example of this procedure follows. Example 6.3 A fast reactor assembly consisting of a homogeneous mixture of 239pu and sodium is to be made in the form of a bare sphere. The atom densities of these constituents are NF = 0.00395 X 1024 for the 239pu and Ns = 0.0234 X 1024 for the sodium. Estimate the critical radius Rc of the assembly. Solution.

[Ans.] Chap. 6 The reverse of this problem-namely, the calculation of the critical composi­ tion or mass of a reactor whose size is given-is somewhat more complicated, at least for a fast reactor, and is delayed until the discussion of thermal reactors in the next section. To return to Eq. (6.50), this may be rearranged and put into the following form, koo ---- =1 1 + B2L2 ' (6.51) where the sUbscript denoting the first or critical eigenvalue has been omitted, and where it is understood that, from this point on, B2 refers to the buckling for a critical reactor. Equation (6.51) is known as the one-group critical equation for a bare reactor. It is instructive to examine the physical meaning of the critical equation. For this purpose, consider a critical bare reactor of arbitrary geometry. The number of neutrons absorbed in this reactor per second is �a f v ¢d V However, the number that leak from the surface of the reactor per second is given by fA J n d A, where J is the neutron current density at the surface, n is a unit vector normal to the surface, and the integral is evaluated over the entire surface. From Fick's law and the divergence theorem, L J ndA = Iv div JdV = -D Iv V2q,dV. (6.52)

[6.5]), this can be written as -D Iv V2</>dV = DB2 Iv </>dV (6.53) Neutrons may either leak from the reactor or be absorbed within its interior­ there is no other alternative. Therefore, the relative probability, PL, that a neutron is absorbed -that is, will not leak-is equal to the number absorbed in the reactor per second divided by the sum of that number and the number of neutrons that leak. From the results of the preceding paragraph, it follows that ba Iv ¢dV ba PL = Ea Iv </JdV + DB2 Iv ¢dV = Ea + DB2· Dividing numerator and denomina tor by Ea gives 1 PL ----­-1 + B2L2' (6.54) where the definition of L2 has been used. Equation (6.54) is the one-group formula for the nonleakage probability for a bare reactor. Comparing Eqs. (6.51) and (6.54) shows that the critical equation can be writ­ ten as (6.55) This result has the following interpretati on. A total of ba Iv ¢ dV neutrons are absorbed in the reactor per second, and this leads to the release of ,.,fEa Iv </> dV = koo Ea</> dV fission neutrons. Owing to leakage, however, only PLkoo Ea Iv ¢ d V of these are absorbed in the system to initiate a new generation of neutrons.

Example 6.4 What is the average probability that a fission neutron in the assembly described in Example 6.3 is absorbed within the system? Solution. The probability in question is the nonleakage probability given in Eq. (6.54). Using the values Ii = 48.5 cm and L2 = 384 cm2 from the example gives

[Ans.] 1 + (4�.5) x 384 Chap. 6 Thus, there is a 38% chance that a neutron will be absorbed and a 62% chance that it will escape. 6.5 THERMAL REACTORS Thennal reactors are sufficiently distinctive to warrant separate discussion. It is recalled that these systems contain fuel, coolant, various structural materials, and a moderator to slow down the fission neutrons to thennal energies. For convenience, in this section, all the materials in the reactor other than fuel are called moderator. In short, the reactor is assumed to consist only of fuel and moderator. The Four-Factor Formula To begin with, consider an infinite reactor composed of a homogeneous fuel­moderator mixture. If 1:a is the macroscopic thennal absorption cross-section of the mixture, that is, (6.57) where 1:aF and 1:aM are the cross-sections of the fuel and moderator, respectively, then there is a total of 1:a¢T neutrons absorbed per cm3/sec everywhere in the reactor, where ¢T is the thennal flux (see Section 5.9). Of this number, the fraction f = 1:aF = 'faF 1:a 1:aF + 1:aM (6.58) is absorbed by the fuel. The parameter, f, which was called the fuel utilization in Section 6.1, is known as the thermal utilization in thennal reactors. There are f1:a¢T neutrons absorbed per cm3/sec in fuel. As a result, 'IT f1:a¢T fission neutrons are emitted per cm3/sec, where 'IT is the average number of neutrons emitted per thennal neutron absorbed in fuel. The parameter 'IT is computed from the integral f 'I(E)auF(E)¢(E) dE 'IT = f aaF(E)¢(E) dE ' (6.59) where ¢(E) is the Maxwellian flux given by Eq. (5.49). Values of 'IT are given in Table 6.3, where it is observed that 'IT is a slowly varying function of temperature. In thennal reactors containing large amounts of fissionable but nonfissile ma­terials such as 238U, a small fraction of the fissions is induced by fast neutrons

These fast fissions can be taken into ac­ count by introducing a factor E; called the fast fission factor, which is defined as the ratio of the total number of fission neutrons produced by both fast and ther­ mal fission to the number produced by thennal fission alone. It follows from this definition that the total number of fission neutrons produced per cm3/sec in an infi­ nite thennal reactor is equal to E1JT f"£a¢T. The value of E for reactors fueled with natural or slightly enriched uranium ranges from about 1.02 to 1.08. As already noted, there can be no leakage of neutrons from an infinite reactor; all of the fission neutrons must eventually be absorbed somewhere in the reactor. In a thennal reactor, most of the neutrons are absorbed after they have slowed down to thennal energies. However, some neutrons may be absorbed while slowing down by nuclei having absorption resonances at energies above the thennal region. If p is the probability that a fission neutron is not absorbed in any of these resonances, then, of the E1JT f"£a¢T fission neutrons produced per cm3/sec, only pE1JT f"£a¢T actually succeed in slowing down to thennal energies. The parameter p is known as the resonance escape probability and is one of the most important factors in the design of a thennal reactor. From the foregoing discussion, it follows that the absorption of "£a¢T ther­ mal neutrons leads to the production of pE1JT f"£a¢T new thennal neutrons, all of which must eventually be absorbed in an infinite reactor. The absorption of this generation of thennal neutrons leads to another generation of thennal neutrons, and so on. The multiplication factor of the reactor is therefore koo = pE1JT f"£a¢T = 1JT fPE, "£a¢T (6.60) where the subscript on koo again signifies that the equation is valid only for infinite systems. Since koo is the product of four factors-1JT, f, p, and E-Eq. (6.60) is called the four-factor formula. It may be noted that the order of the factors in the right-hand side of Eq. (6.60) has been rearranged to confonn with nonnal usage.

 text: 288 Nuclear Reactor Theory Chap. 6 Criticality Calculations The one-group method, at least in the form given earlier in this Chapter, gives only rough estimates of the critical size or composition of a thermal reactor. This is due to the fact that, although most of the fission neutrons are ultimately absorbed at thermal energies, they may diffuse about over considerable distances while slowing down. Such fast-neutron diffusion must be taken into consideration. To this end, as discussed in Section 5.10, it is usual to describe a thermal reactor by at least two neutron groups: one group for the fast neutrons-those with energies above the thermal region-and a second group for the thermal neutrons. In such a two-group calculation, it can usually be assumed that there is no absorption of neutrons in the fast group; resonance absorption is taken into account by the introduction of the resonance escape probability. Neutrons are then lost from the fast group only as a result of scattering into the thermal group. In particular, following the discussion in Section 5.10, there are L 1 ¢ 1 neutrons scattered per cm3/sec out of the fast group, where ¢l is the fast flux. Also, in a thermal reactor, it can be assumed that the bulk of the fissions is induced by thermal neutrons; the few fissions induced by fast neutrons are accounted for in the fast fission factor. It follows that TJT f E La¢T = (koo/ p) La¢T fission neutrons are emitted per cm3/sec, and these neutrons necessarily appear as source neutrons in the fast group. The source density for the fast group is therefore koo- Sl = -La¢T. p Substituting this expression into the group diffusion equation (see Eq. [5.45]) gives the following equation for the fast group: 2 koo-Dl V ¢l -Ll¢l + -La¢T = 0. p (6.61) In the absence of resonance absorption, all of the L 1 ¢l neutrons per cm3/sec scattered out of the fast group would appear as source neutrons in the thermal flux equation. With resonance absorption present, however, only p L 1 ¢l neutrons per cm3/sec actually succeed in entering the thermal group. Thm;, the thermal source term is Introducing this expression into the thermal diffusion equation then gives -2 -DV ¢T -L.a¢T + PLl¢l = O. (6.62) Equations (6.61) and (6.62) are the two-group equations describing a bare thennal reactor.

page number: 307
 text: Sec. 6.5 Thermal Reactors 289 It is not difficult to show that, in a bare reactor, all group fluxes have the same spatial dependence, which is determined by the one-group reactor equation. Thus, for a bare thennal reactor, the two-group fluxes may be written as where Al and A2 are constants and ¢ satisfies the equation V2¢ + B2¢ = o. Substituting the last three equations into Eqs. (6.61) and (6.62) yields and 2 koo--(DIB + �I)AI + -�aA2 = 0 p (6.63) (6.64) (6.65) (6.66) (6.67) Equations (6.66) and (6.67) are a set of homogeneous linear algebraic equations in the two unknowns, Al and A2. According to Cramer's rule,4 Eqs. (6.66) and (6.67) have nontrivial solutions only if the detenninant of the coefficients mUltiplying A I and A2 vanishes-that is, if �� I _(D�2 � �a) = o. 4Consider the set of homogeneous linear equations: alIXI aI2X2 a21XI a22X2 alNXN = 0, a2NXN = 0, where amn are constants. Cramer's rule states that there is no solution other than XI = X2 = XN = 0 unless the determinant of the coefficients amn vanishes-that is, =0. When this equation is satisfied, the equations in the original set are not independent. That is, although there appear to be N distinct equations in the set, at least one of these equations can be written as a combination of other equations in the set. Since there are N unknowns, but only N -1 independent equations, it is possible to determine only N -1 of the xs in terms of the remaining x.

In this expression, (l + B2L})(l + B2TT) 2 D LT = =­ba Chap. 6 (6.68) (6.69) is the thennal diffusion area discussed in Section 5.9, and TT is the parameter called neutron age, which was defined in Section 5.10 as Dl TT=-· bl (6.70) Equation (6.68) is the two-group critical equation for a bare thennal reactor. The factor 1 PT----­-1+B2L} (6.71) in this equation was shown in Section 6.4 to be the probability that a thennal neutron will not leak from the reactor. Also, it is not difficult to show that 1 PF=----1 + B2TT (6.72) is the probability that a fission neutron will not escape from the reactor while slowing down. Therefore, by the argument given in Section 6.4, it follows that the left-hand side of Eq. (6.68) is the multiplication factor of the reactor-that is, (6.73) and the critical equation follows by writing k = 1. Since all reactors are designed in such a way that there is as little leakage of neutrons as possible, both PT and PF are ordinarily very close to unity. The quantities B2 L} and B2TT are therefore small. When the denominator of the critical

page number: 309
 text: Sec. 6.5 Thermal Reactors 291 equation, Eq. (6.68), is multiplied out, the tenn B4 L} TT can often be ignored. The resulting expression is or where koo -----::- --- = 1 1 + B2(L} + TT) is called the thermal migration area. (6.74) (6.75) It is observed that Eq. (6.74) is identical in fonn to the critical equation (Eq. [6.51]) in a one-group calculation. For this reason, Eq. (6.74) is known as the mod­ified one-group critical equation-modified in the sense that L2 in the one-group equation has been replaced by M;. Furthennore, from Eqs. (6.64) and (6.65), it follows that the thennal flux is given by the same equation as in a one-group calculation-namely, (6.76) where B2 is the buckling given in Table 6.2. Thus, the only difference between an ordinary one-group calculation and a modified one-group calculation of a bare thennal reactor is that, in the latter, L} is replaced by M;; the flux and the buckling are the same as before. It may be noted that if TT is much less than L}, Eq. (6.74) reduces to the one­ group critical equation, Eq. (6.51). In this case, the reactor is well described by one-group theory. A comparison of the values of TT and L} in Tables 5.2 and 5.3 shows that, with the exception of water, TT is in fact less than L} for the common moderators ; it is much less than L} for D20 and graphite. Therefore, it would be quite wrong to use an ordinary one-group calculation, omitting TT, for a water­ moderated reactor. Somewhat less error would be involved in such a computation of a D20 or graphite-mode rated system, provided the value of L}, with fuel mixed in with the moderator, is still substantially larger than TT. Applications The prior results can now be applied to the practical problem of detennining the critical composition or critical dimensions of a bare thermal reactor. For simplicit y, the discussion is limited to reactors that do not contain resonance absorbers or nuclei that undergo fast fission. In short, the reactor is assumed to consist of a

page number: 310
 text: 292 Nuclear Reactor Theory Chap. 6 homogeneous mixture of a fissile isotope such as 235U and moderator. In this case, p = E = l. Then according to Eq. (6.60), koo reduces to koo = l1T /. (6.77) Reactors with resonance absorption and fast fission are treated in Section 6.8. It is recalled that there are two situations to be considered: (a) the physical size of the reactor is specified and its critical composition must be determined, or (b) the composition of the reactor is specified and its critical size must be determined. These problems are each taken up in tum. Case 1. Size Specified With size given, B2 can be immediately computed from the appropriate formula in Table 6.2. The composition must then be adjusted so that koo and M� have the values necessary to satisfy the critical equation, Eq. (6.74). It is first convenient to introduce the parameter Z defined by (6.78) where, as usual, the subscripts F and M denote the fuel and moderator, respectively. Then from Eq. (6.58), the thermal utilization can be written as Z /=Z+1" In view of Eq. (6.77), koo takes the form l1TZ k ---00-Z+I· (6.79) (6.80) Consider next the thermal diffusion area, which is one of the two factors entering into M� (see Eq. [6.75]). From Eq. (6.69), 2 D LT = =-, La where D and L a refer to the homogeneous mixture of fuel and moderator. However, D is essentially equal to DM, the diffusion coefficient for the moderator, since the concentration of the fuel in the moderator is ordinarily small for homogeneous thermal reactors.

(6.78) gives 2 L}M L - --T -Z + l' (6.81) where L}M is the thermal diffusion area of the moderator. On solving Eq. (6.79) for Z and substituting into Eq. (6.81), the result is (6.82) The age TT, like D, depends primarily on the scattering properties of the medium. In the homogeneous type of reactor under consideration, very little fissile material is necessary to reach criticality. Furthermore, the scattering cross-sections of fissile atoms are not significa ntly larger than those of the ordinary moderators . It is possible, therefore, to ignore the presence of the fuel altogether and use for TT the value of the age for the moderator alone, TTM, which is given in Table 5.3. Introducing Eqs. (6.80) and (6.81) into the critical equation (Eq. 6.74) then gives 1JTZ 2 = 1. Z + 1 + B2(LTM + ZTTM + TTM) When this equation is solved for Z, the result is found to be 1 + B2(L}M + TTM) Z= . 1JT - 1 - B2TTM (6.83) This is the value of Z, which leads to a critical reactor with the specified value of B2 To find the total mass of fuel required for criticality using this value of Z­ that is, the critical mass-the procedure is as follows. From Eq. (6.78), the atom density of the fuel is (6.84) The total number of fuel atoms in the reactor is NF V, where V is the reactor vol­ ume, and the total number of moles of fuel is NF V / NA, where NA is Avogadro 's number. If MF is the gram atomic weight of the fuel, it follows that mF, the fuel mass, is given by mF=--­NA <JaMVMF =Z ----<JaFNA (6.85) (6.86)

page number: 312
 text: 294 Nuclear Reactor Theory Chap. 6 However, the total mass of the moderator is NMVMM mM=---­NA so that Eq. (6.86) can also be written as (6.87) Introducing the formulas given in Chapter 5 for (TaM and (TaF (see Eq. [5.59]) gives finally uaM(Eo)MF mF = Z mM, gaF(T)uaF(Eo)MM (6.88) where the non-lIv factor of the moderator has been taken to be unity and the cross­sections are evaluated at the energy Eo = 0.0253 e V. Because the fuel concentration is normally so small, the moderator mass can be computed using its ordinary density as shown in the following example. Example 6.5 A bare spherical thennal reactor, 100 cm in radius, consists of a homogeneous mixture of235U and graphite. The reactor is critical and operates at a power level of 100 thermal kilowatts. Using modified one-group theory, calculate (a) the buckling; (b) the critical mass; (c) koo; (d) L}; (e) the thennal flux. For simplicity, make all computations at room temperature. Solution. 1.

(6.88) gives 6.87 x 0.0034 x 235 . 4 mF = mM = 6.87 x 10-mM. 0.978 x 681 x 12 The density of graphite is approximately 1.60 g/cm3, so the total mass of graphite in the reactor is mM = �rr R3 x 1.60 = 6.70 x 106 g = 6, 700 kg. It follows that the critical mass is mF = 6.87 x 10-4 x 6,700 = 4.60 kg. [Ans.]

page number: 314
 text: 296 Nuclear Reactor Theory Chap. 6 If the geometry of the reactor is specified, the dimensions can then be determined from the appropriate formula for B2 in Table 6.2. Thus, for a cubical reactor of side a and d small, a = n -J3 / B; for a sphere, the critical radius is R = n / B. However, if it is only specified that the reactor is, say, a finite cylinder, then the buckling formula in the table only provides a relationship between its height H and radius R, which must be satisfied if the reactor is critical. Each combination of Hand R leads to a different reactor volume and hence a different critical mass. It is not difficult to show that this mass is smallest when Hand R satisfy the relationship H = 1.82R. The cross-section through the axis of such a cylinder is almost square. The parallelepiped with least volume, as might be expected, is a cube. Example 6.6 A 5-watt experimental thermal reactor is constructed in the form of a cylinder. The reactor is fueled with a homogeneous mixture of 235U and ordinary water with a fuel concentration of 0.0145 g/cm3 Because of its low power, the system operates at essentially room temperature and atmospheric pressure. (a) Calculate the dimensions of the cylinder that has the smallest critical mass. (b) Determine the critical mass. Solution. 1. The ratio of the number of atoms of 235U per cm3 to water molecules per cm3 is where PF and PM are the densities of 235U and water in the mixture, respec­ tively, and MF and MM are their gram atomic and molecular weights.

[Ans.] 6.6 REFLECTE D REACTORS It is pointed out in Chapter 4 that the neutron economy is improved when the core of a reactor is surrounded by a reflector-that is, by a thick, unfueled region of moderator. The neutrons that otherwise would leak from the bare core now pass into the reflector, and some of these diffuse back into the core. The net result is that the critical size, and hence mass of the system is reduced. Criticality calculations for reflected reactors are now considered within the framework of the one-group diffusion theory. It is recalled that this method is

Reflected water reactors for which iT » L} are treated separately later in this section. As a specific example, consider a spherical reactor consisting of a core of ra­dius R surrounded by an infinite reflector. In the following analysis, parameters that refer to the core and reflector are denoted by the subscripts c and r, respectively. According to the one-group theory, the flux in the core ¢c satisfies the equa­tion (see Eq. [6.5]) where for a critical reactor 2 koo -1 B = . L2 c (6.90) (6.91) Since there is no fuel in the reflector, the flux in this region satisfies the one-group diffusion equation 2 1 V ¢r -2¢r = O. Lr (6.92) To find the flux throughout the reactor and the conditions for criticality, it is neces­sary to solve Eqs. (6.90) and (6.92) for ¢c and ¢r subject to boundary conditions. The general solution to Eq. (6.90) is derived in Section 6.3 and is sin Br cos Br ¢c = A-- + C--, r r where A and C are constants. Since ¢c must be finite everywhere, even at the center of the reactor (at r = 0), it is necessary to place C = 0 so that ¢c reduces to sinBr ¢c=A --. r The general solution to Eq. (6.92) is e-r/Lr er/Lr ¢r = A'--+ C' --, r r (6.93) where A' and C' are constants. However, lPr must remain finite as r goes to infinity, and C' must therefore be taken to be zero. The flux in the reflector is then e-r/Lr lPr = A'--. r (6.94) The functions lPc and lPr must also satisfy the interface boundary condi­tions (see Section 5.5)-namely, continuity of neutron flux. Similarly, the radial

Written out in detail, these conditions are and or where the prime indicates differentiation with respect to r. Introducing Eqs. (6.93) and (6.94) into Eq. (6.95) gives ASinBR e-R/L, ---=A'--R R (6.95) (6.96) (6.97) Next, differentiating Eqs. (6.93) and (6.94) and inserting the results into Eq. (6.96) yields AD - = -A D -+ -e ' ( B cos B R sin B R ) I (1 1) _ R/ L c R R2 r RLr R (6.98) Equations (6.97) and (6.98) are homogeneous linear equations in the unknowns A and A'; they have nontrivial solutions only if the detenninant of the coefficients vanishes. Multiplying out this detenninant (which is equivalent to dividing one equation by the other) gives D (BcotBR -�) = -D (�+�) eR r Lr R For computational purposes, it is convenient to rearrange this equation in the fol­lowing fonn: BRcotBR-1=-- -+1 Dr (R ) Dc Lr (6.99) Equation (6.99) must be satisfied for the reactor to be critical. For example, if the composition of the core is given, then B2 is known from Eq. (6.91), and R can be calculated from Eq. (6.99). However, if R is specified, B2 must be computed from Eq. (6.99), and the critical composition of the core can be detennined by using Eq. (6.91). The only complicating feature of these calculations that is not present with bare reactors is that Eq. (6.99) is a traIlsC�IlcleIltal equation. It is instructive to consider the solution ofEq. (6.99) graphically. For instance, suppose that the composition of the core, and hence B, is specified.

(6.99). core radius can then be found by plotting the left-hand side (LHS) and the right­hand side (RHS) of Eq. (6.99) separately as functions of BR. This is shown in Fig. 6.4. The LHS has an infinite number of branches, each of width rr, while the RHS is a straight line of slope -Dr / DeB Lr 5 that intersects the vertical axis at -Dr / Dc. Every value of B R corresponding to an intersection of the LHS and RHS is a root or solution to Eq. (6.99), and since there are an infinite number of intersections, there are also an infinite number of solutions. However, as explained earlier in this Chapter, only the first solution is relevant to a critical reactor, the higher roots corresponding to solutions that die out in time. With the value of B R obtained from the first intersection and with B known, the critical radius can be immediately detennined. It should be noted in Fig. 6.4 that the first intersection of LHS and RHS occurs at a value of B R that is less than rr. If the reactor is bare instead of reflected, B R is exactly equal to rr. Therefore, it follows that the critical core radius is less for the reflected reactor than for the bare reactor of the same composition-a conclusion that is anticipated on physical grounds. Incidentally, it may be noted that, in the special case in which the moderator in the core and reflector are the same, Dr = Dc, and Eq. (6.99) reduces to 5 As a function of B R, 1 BcotBR = ---.

 text: Sec. 6.6 Reflected Reactors 301 This equation is not transcendental in R. Thus, if B is known, R can be calculated directly. This case is illustrated in Example 6.8. Having obtained the condition for criticality, it is now necessary to return to Eqs. (6.97) and (6.98) and find the values of the constants A and A' that detennine the flux. These equations are not independent, however, but are related through Eq. (6.99). It is possible, therefore, to find A' in tenns of A or A in tenns of A', but both constants cannot be found independently. For example, from Eq. (6.97), A' is A' = AeR/Lr sin B R, (6.101) where B R is the known solution to Eq. (6.99). The constant A, which fixes the magnitude of the flux throughout the reactor, is detennined by the reactor power. As in Section 6.3, this is given by (6.102) where the integral extends over the reactor core-the power-producing region. In­serting ¢c from Eq. (6.93) and using the volume element dV = 4nr2 dr gives P = 4JfER1:fA foR rsinBrdr 4n ER� fA = B2 (sin BR -BR cos BR). When this is solved for A, the result is PB2 A= -----------------------4nERLf(sinBR -BRcosBR) (6.103) The prior procedure-solving the core and reflector equations, obtaining an equation that must be satisfied for criticality, and evaluating the flux constants in tenns of the reactor power-can be carried through analytically for only a few reactors-namely, the fully reflected parallelepiped and cylinder. In practice, the properties of these reactors are often estimated from calculations of spherical reac­tors of the same composition and volume. It may be noted that the analysis of reflected reactors is carried out in this section without regard for whether the reactors are fast or thennal. The various fonnulas derived earlier are therefore valid for both types of systems. To use these fonnulas in calculations of thennal reactors, it is merely necessary to replace each reactor parameter with its appropriate thermal averaged value. The one-group flux is then the thennal flux provided the one-group approximation holds. This is illus­trated in the next example.

To do so requires a two-group or multi­group calculation. Although such computations for a reflected reactor are beyond the scope of this book, the results are interesting and have an important bearing on the design of a thermal reactor. To be specific, consider a two-group calculation of a reflected system. As usual, the fast flux, ¢1, describes the behavior of the fast neutrons; the thermal

One of the striking results of such a computation is that the thermal flux is found to rise near the core-reflector interface and exhibits a peak in the reflector as shown in Fig. 6.5. The behavior of CPT, which is not predicted in one-group theory, is due to the thermalization in the reflector of fast neutrons escaping from the core. The thermalized neutrons are not absorbed as quickly in the reflector as neutrons thermalized in the core since the reflector, being unfueled, has a much smaller absorption cross-section. The thermal neutrons tend to accumulate in the reflector until they leak back into the core, escape from the outer surface of the reflector, or are absorbed. An important consequence of the rise in the thermal flux in the reflector is that it tends to flatten the thermal flux distribution in the core. This effect can be seen in Fig. 6.5, which also shows the flux for the bare reactor. The flux in the core near the core-reflector interface is built up by the flow of thermal neutrons out of the reflector. Thus, a reflector not only reduces the critical size and mass of a reactor, it also reduces the maximum-to-average flux ratio. Reflector Savings The decrease in the critical dimensions of a reactor core as the result of the use of a reflector is called the reflector savings. Thus, for a spherical reactor, if Ro is the radius of the bare core and R is the core radius with the reflector present, the reflector savings is defined as 8 = Ro -R. (6.104)

page number: 324
 text: 306 Nuclear Reactor Theory Chap. 6 For instance, for the reactor in Example 6.8, the reflected core radius is 268 cm, whereas the radius of a bare reactor of the same composition is 322 cm. The reflec­tor savings in this case is 8 = 322 -268 = 54 cm. For a slab reactor of unreflected and reflected core thickness, ao and a, re­spectively, the reflector savings is defined as ao a 8= ---2 2' where the factor £lo/2 -al2 is necessary because the slab has two sides. (6.105) If the reflector savings is known beforehand, the calculation of the critical di­mensions of a reflected reactor requires only the solution of the far simpler problem of the bare reactor. Thus?-,for the reflected sphere, it is only necessary to"""determine the bare critical radius R o; the reflected radius is then simply R = Ro -8. Of course, a knowledge of 8 requires either an analytical or experimental solution to the reflected reactor problem. The practical importance of the reflector savings lies in the fact that 8 is relatively insensitive to changes in the composition of the reac­tor. This means that if 8 is determined for one reactor, then the same value of 8 can be used for a different reactor of similar composition. For two-and three-dimensional reactor configurations, the reflector savings must be accounted for in each of the terms contributing to the buckling. Consider the case of a fully reflected finite cylindrical reactor with reflectors on the top, bottom, and sides of the cylinder. From Table 6.2, the buckling for the bare reactor is given by Accounting for the extrapolation distance d, """ """ where Rand H are given by and respectively. R=R+d H = H+2d, For the fully reflected case, the reflector savings must be accounted for and these become R=R+8

page number: 325
 text: Sec. 6.6 Reflected Reactors 307 and H = H +28. If the cylinder is reflected on only the bottom and not the top, then H is given by H = H +d+8. For purposes of making rough calculations of reflected dimensions and/or critical masses of thennal reactors, except those moderated or reflected with water, the following simple fonnula can be used to estimate 8: Dc 8 :::::: =-LTr, Dr (6.106) where the symbols have their usual meanings. Equation (6.106) is only valid pro­vided the reflector is several diffusion lengths thick. In this case, the reflector is effectively infinite; that is, an increase in reflector thickness does not reduce the critical size of the core. In practice, virtually all reactors have reflectors that are many diffusion lengths thick, and hence can be thought of as infinite. As mentioned earlier, the one-group method, employed in this section to treat reflected reactors, cannot be accurately applied to water-moderated and water­reflected systems, because TT is much larger than L}. However, to handle these types of reactors, the following empirical fonnula, developed by R. W. Deutsch, may be used to obtain the reflector savings: 8 = 7.2 + 0.10(Mi -40.0), (6.107) where 8 is in cm, and M�, the migration area of the core, is in cm2 The use of Eq. (6.107) is illustrated by the following example. Example 6.9 Calculate the critical core radius and critical mass of a spherical reactor, moderated and reflected by unit-density water. The core contains 235U at a concentration of 0.0145 g/cm3 (as in Example 6.6). Solution. From Example 6.6, M� = 30.8 cm2 and so 8 = 7.2 + 0.10(30.8 -40.0) = 6.3 cm. Also from that example, B2 = 2.80 X 10-3 cm-2 so that B = 0.0529. The bare radius is given by � Jr Jr Ro = - = -- = 59.4 cm B 0.0529 '

page number: 326
 text: 308 Nuclear Reactor Theory Chap. 6 and the reflected radius is R = Ro -8 = 59.4 -6.3 = 53.1 cm. [Ans.] The critical mass is then 4 mF = 0.0145 x "3 x rr x (53.1)3 = 9.09 X 103 g = 9.09 kg. [Ans.] This is considerably less than the 14.5 kg for the unreflected reactor of Example 6.6. 6.7 MULTIGROUP CALCU LATIONS The one-group method gives only the roughest estimates of the properties of a crit­ical reactor. To obtain more accurate results, it is necessary to perfonn multigroup calculations of the type described in Section 5.8. To set up the multigroup equations for a critical reactor, three new group constants must first be defined: � fg = the group-averaged macroscopic fission cross-section; Vg = the average number of fission neutrons released as the result of fissions induced by neutrons in the gth group; and Xg = the fraction of fission neutrons that are emitted with energies in the gth group. The number of fissions per cm3/sec in the hth group can now be written as � fh¢h, where ¢h is the flux in the hth group. As a result of these fissions, Vh � fh¢h neutrons are released. The total number of neutrons emitted as the result of fissions in all groups is then L Vh � fh¢h, where the sum is carried out over all groups. If the fraction Xg of these neutrons appears in the gth group, it follows that the source tenn Sg for the gth multigroup equation, Eq. (5.45), is N Sg = Xg L vh�fh¢h' h=1 Introducing this expression into Eq. (5.45) then gives N g-1 N (6.108) Dg V2¢g -�ag¢g -L �g�h¢g + L �h�g¢h + Xg L Vh L fh¢h = O. h=g+l h=l h=l This is the gth group equation in a set of N multigroup equations. (6.109)

page number: 327
 text: Sec. 6.8 Heterogeneous Reactors 309 For the usual reactor, which has several regions of differing material proper­ties, there is a set of equations like those represented by Eq. (6.109) for each region. In this case, it is necessary to solve the equations in each region and satisfy bound­ary conditions at every interface as well as at the reactor surface. This procedure can only be carried out in a practical way with a high-speed computer, and many computer programs have been written for solving the multi group equations (e.g. DIF3D). For an infinite reactor, the fluxes are independent of position, ¢g = constant, V2¢g = 0, and the multigroup equations reduce to a set of linear algebraic equa­tions with constant coefficients in the unknowns ¢l, ¢2, , ¢N. Since these are homogeneous equations, according to Cramer's rule, there can be no solutions other than ¢1 = ¢2 = = ¢ N = ° unless the determinant of the coefficients of the fluxes is equal to zero, which is actually the requirement for the critical­ity of the infinite system. By changing the concentration of the fuel, the value of the determinant also changes. The concentration for which the determinant is zero is the composition required for the system to be critical. The relative magnitudes of the fluxes ¢1, ¢2, can be found by solving the multigroup linear equations using values for the coefficients computed at the critical composition. Absolute values of the fluxes are not obtained, however, because these depend on the reactor power level. Nevertheless, the relative values of the flux are sufficient to estimate the energy dependence of the flux or neutron spectrum in the reactor. Such calculations of neutron spectra in infinite reactors are used in reactor de­sign in the following way. Because of the complexity of the multi group equations for a finite, multiregion reactor, it is often too costly in computer time to utilize a large number of groups in multi group computations, especially in the early stages of the design of a reactor when these computations must be carried out repeat­edly with varying design parameters. Therefore, it is more practical to perform the initial design calculations for the finite reactor using only a few groups, but with multigroup calculations carried out with a large number of groups for the infinite reactor. Only when the design of a reactor has been more or less decided on, are large-scale, space-dependent multi group calculations undertaken. These provide accurate estimates of the critical mass, the flux and power distributions, and other properties of the system. 6.8 HETEROG ENEOUS REACTORS Up to this point, it has been assumed that the reactor core consists of a homoge­neous mixture of fissile material, coolant, and, if the reactor is thermal, moderator, whereas in most reactors, the fuel is actually contained in fuel rods of one sort or another. Such nonhomogeneous reactors are divided into two classes. If the neutron mean free path at all neutron energies is large compared with the thickness of the

page number: 328
 text: 310 Nuclear Reactor Theory Chap. 6 fuel rods, then it is unlikely that a neutron will have more than one successive colli­sion within anyone fuel rod. In this case, the reactor core is homogeneous as far as the neutrons are concerned and the reactor is called quasi-homogeneous. However, if the neutron mean free path at some energy is comparable to or smaller than the thickness of a fuel rod, then the neutrons may undergo several collisions within a fuel rod, the fuel and moderator must be treated as separate regions, and the reactor is said to be heterogeneous. Reactors with fuel rods in the form of thin plates are often of the quasi-homogeneous type, especially if the fuel is highly enriched and therefore present in the rod at low concentration. Most modem (thermal) power reactors, however, are fueled with only slightly enriched (a few weight percent) uranium, the fuel rods are not thin, and these reactors are heterogeneous. From the standpoint of the neutrons, a quasi-homogeneous reactor is in fact homogeneous. Thus, the formulas developed in the preceding sections for homo­geneous systems can be used with quasi-homogeneous reactors. It is merely neces­sary in the computations to use the atom densities for the equivalent homogeneous reactors as shown in the following example. Example 6.10 The fuel plates of a mobile thermal reactor are thin fuel sandwiches as shown in Fig. 6.6. The cladding is zirconium, and the meat is a mixture of 235U and zirconium, containing approximately 150 atoms of zirconium for every atom of uranium. Both the cladding and meat are 0.05 cm thick. The plates are immersed in a water moder­ ator coolant in such a way that the total volumes of the plates and the water are the same. At room temperature: (a) What is the mean free path of thermal neutrons in the zirconium cladding and the meat? (b) What is the value of koo for the system? Solution. 1. According to Table Ir.3, the atom density of zirconium, Nz, in units of 1024, is 0.0429, and its total cross-section at thermal energies is approximately 6.6 b. Meat, 0.05 em thick Cladding, 0.05 em thick Figure 6.6 A fuel plate sandwich.

page number: 329
 text: Sec. 6.8 Heterogeneous Reactors 311 The mean free path in the cladding is therefore A = 1/�t = 1/0.0429 x 6.6 = 3.5 cm. [Ans.] To find the mean free path in the meat, it is necessary to compute �t for the 235U-zirconium mixture. Since the uranium is only present as an impu­ rity, the atom concentration of the zirconium in the meat is the same as in the cladding-that is, Nz = 0.0429. The atom concentration of the 235U is then N25 = 0.0429/150 = 2.86 x 10-4 For 235U, at = aa + as = 681 + 8.9 � 690 b. Thus, for the meat6 �t = 2.86 X 10-4 x 690 + 0.0429 x 6.6 = 0.480 cm- The mean free path is then A = 1/�t = 2.1 cm. [Ans.] The mean free path in the cladding is 3.5/0.05 = 70 times larger than the thickness of the cladding, whereas it is 2.1/0.05 = 42 times larger in the meat. The reactor core is clearly quasi-homogeneous. 2. As usual, koo = 17T f, where 17T = 2.065 for 235U at room temperature. To compute f, the atom densities of water, zirconium, and 235U of the equivalent homogenized mixture must be used. Since the water and zirconium each oc­ cupy one-half the volume, their respective atom densities are just one-half their normal values. In units of 1024: Nw = 0.5 x 0.0334 = 0.0167, where 0.0334 is the molecular density of unit-density water, and Nz = 0.5 x 0.0429 = 0.0215. The uranium is present in a volume equal to one-third of the sandwich or one­ sixth of the total volume, and its atom density there is 2.86 x 10-4 so that for the mixture N25 = 2.86 X 10-4/6 = 4.77 x 10-5 At 0.0253 eV, the microscopic absorption cross-sections of 235U, zirconium, and water (per molecule) are 681 b, 0.185 b, and 0.664 b, respectively. At 20oe, the non-l/v factor for 235U is 0.978. The value of f is then 6This calculation would appear to violate the provisions of Section 3.3-that thermal scatter­ ing cross-sections must not be added. However, most of the contribution from the fuel to l: is from absorption, and this can be added to scattering.

[Ans.] Calculations for heterogeneous thennal reactors are considerably more diffi­cult than those for homogeneous reactors. It is still possible to write koo = 1JT f pE, and to use the equations for criticality derived earlier, but the factors in these for­mulas must be computed with some care. The Value of TIT Most heterogeneous reactors are fueled with natural or partially enriched uranium in metallic or oxide fonn. The tenn fuel then refers to a mixture of 235U, 238U, and oxygen. In either case, 1JT can be found from the fonnula V25 b /25 1JT = , ba25 + ba28 since the absorption cross-section of oxygen is essentially zero. Example 6.11 Compute the value of TIT for natural uranium at room temperature. Solution. It is convenient first to rewrite Eq. (6.110) in the form V250" /25 TIT = ----':::----_ N28_ O"a25 + -O"a28 N25 (6.l10) The ratio N28/ N25 = 138 for natural uranium. Then using the values V25 = 2.42, 0"/25 = 582 b, g/25 (20°C) = 0.976, O"a25 = 681 b, ga25 (20°C) = 0.978, O"a28 = 2.70 b, ga28 (20°C) = 1.0017 gives 2.42 x 582 x 0.976 32 A TIT = = 1. . [ ns.] 681 x 0.978 + 138 x 2.70 x 1.0017 Thermal Utilization Thermal utilization is defined as the probability that a thennal neutron, if it is ultimately absorbed in the core, is in fact absorbed in fuel. This, in tum, is equal to the ratio of the number of neutrons that are absorbed in fuel per second to the number absorbed per second in both fuel and moderator. 7 7It is assumed here that the reactor core consists of only fuel and moderator. In real reactors, cladding, structural materials, control rods, and other materials are always present.

page number: 331
 text: Sec. 6.8 Heterogeneous Reactors The number of neutrons absorbed in the fuel per second is given by { L.aF¢T dV lVF 313 where L.aF is the macroscopic thermal absorption cross-section of the fuel, and the integration is carried out over the volume of the fuel VF. This number can also be written as L.aF¢T VF, where ¢tF is the average thermal flux in the fuel. The number of neutrons absorbed per second in the moderator is given by a similar expression, so that f becomes f = L.aF¢TF VF L.aF¢TF VF + L.aM¢TM VM (6.111) By dividing the numerator and denominator of Eq.

The values of ¢TF and ¢TM cannot be calculated exactly except by numerical methods. However, the qualitative behavior of the flux in the fuel and moderator is shown in Fig. 6.7. It is seen that the flux is smaller in the fuel than in the moderator. This is to be expected on physical grounds since the absorption cross-section of the fuel is so much higher than that of the moderator. It also follows that ¢TF is smaller than ¢TM, so that from Eq. (1.113), � is greater than unity. This fact has important consequences that are considered later in this section. I Moderator Fuel I Moderator Figure 6.7 Neutron flux in and near a fuel rod.

Although f cannot be calculated analytically, it is possible to derive approxi­mate formulas for this parameter. In these approximations, an infinite array or lattice of fuel rods is divided into unit cells as shown in Fig. 6.8. Calculations of the rate at which neutrons are absorbed in the fuel and moderator are then carried out in the equivalent cylindrical cell-that is, the cell whose volume is equal to that of the noncylindrical cell. This procedure is called the Wigner-Seitz method. The results of these calculations are usually presented in the following form: 1 f (6.114) where F and E are called lattice functions. In the simplest calculations of these functions, in which diffusion theory is assumed to be valid in both the fuel and moderator, F and E are given by and xIO(X) F(x) ---2h(x) E(y, z) = Z2 -y2 [Io(Y)K1(Z) + Ko(Y)h(Z)] 2y h (z)K1 (y) -Kl (z)h (y) In these formulas, x = a/LF, (6.115) (6.116) where a is the radius of the fuel rod, b is the radius of the equivalent cell, and LF and LM are the thermal diffusion lengths of the fuel and moderator, respectively.

A short table of these functions is given in Appendix V. Equations (6.115) and (6.116) are reasonably accurate for reactors in which a « b-that is, reactors in which the moderator volume is much larger than the fuel volume. This is usually the case in large gas-cooled reactors. However, these equations provide only rough estimates of / for reactors with more tightly packed lattices. Most modern power reactors are of this latter type, and more complicated fonnulas must be used for these systems. It may be mentioned that, when x, y, and z are less than about 0.75, the following series expansions can be used with good accuracy to compute F and E for cylindrical rods: 1 (X)2 1 (X)4 1 (X)6 F(x) = 1 + 2 "2 -12 "2 + 48 "2 Z2 [Z2 ( Z ) 3 y2 E(y, z) = 1 + -In -- -+ -+ 2 Z2 -y2 Y 4 4z2 Example 6.12 (6.117) ] (6.118) The core of an experimental reactor consists of a square lattice of natural uranium rods imbedded in graphite.

It is first necessary to determine the radius b of the cylindrical cell having the same volume as the unit cell. Both cells are shown in Fig. 6.9. These cells are of equal length, so for equal volumes it is necessary that and so b = 25.4/..fii = 14.3 cm. 8The distance between the centers of nearest rods, 25.4 cm in the example, is called the lattice spacing or lattice pitch.

[Ans.] Resonanc e Escape Probability It is recalled from Section 6.5 that the resonance escape probability, as the name implies, is the probability that a fission neutron will escape capture in resonances as it slows down to thermal energies. Analytical-numerical methods have been de­vised for computing p from nuclear cross-section data, but these are beyond the scope of this text. However, many measurements of p have been carried out, and these have shown that p can be expressed approximately by the formula (6.119)

For convenience in making calculations, values of �M LsM are given in Table 6.6. It should be noted that, according to Eq. (6.119), I has dimensions of cross­section. The constants in Table 6.5, when introduced into Eq. (6.120), give I in bams. However, a must be given in cm and p given in g/cm3 Also, it should be pointed out that, although the values of the constants A and C in Table 6.5 are given for the pure resonance absorbers 238U and 232Th, these constants are also valid for slightly enriched uranium and for thorium containing a small quantity of converted 233U. Small amounts of 235U or 233U in the fuel do not significantly alter the extent of resonance absorption in the 238U or the 232Th-the fuel is still essentially all 238U or 232Th, as the case may be.

[Ans.] Fast Fission The fast fission factor, E, the ratio of the total number of neutrons emitted from both thennal and fast fission to the number emitted in thennal fission alone, has been calculated and measured for a large number of heterogeneous reactors. Results of experiments with 1.50 cm diameter, slightly enriched uranium rods9 in ordinary water are shown in Fig. 6.10. It is observed that E increases as the ratio of the uranium volume to water increases. This would be expected physically. Thus with more uranium metal present in the system, the probability is greater that a fission neutron will strike a uranium nucleus before its energy falls below the fast fission 1.15 .----------.----------y--------, 1.5 em rods 1.10 I------+------:.f'''"'--�=-------I 1.05 I---�¥--+-----+-------I 1.00 L...-___ -'-- ___ -----'- ___ ----' o 0.5 1.0 1.5 Metal-water volume ratio Figure 6.10 The fast fission factor as a function of metal-water volume ratio. 9 As noted earlier, most modem power reactors, at least those in the United States, use slightly (2-3 wlo) enriched uranium. Since at low enrichments the 238U content of the fuel is essentially independent of enrichment, the value of E does not depend strongly on enrichment.

It is evident from the figure that E is not a sensitive function of the radius of the fuel rods. Considerable additional data on E, including data on moderators other than water, are found in the report ANL-5800 (see References). The Value of koo It is of interest to compare the values of the parameters in the four-factor formula for a heterogeneous thermal reactor with those of a homogeneous mixture of the same materials. Consider first the thermal utilization, which for the heterogeneous system is given by Eq. (6.111) or (6.112): LaF¢TF VF LaF VF fhetero = ----------LaF¢TF VF + LaM¢TM VM LaF VF + LaM VM� where � is the disadvantage factor (cf. Eq. (6.113). If the system is homogenized, the terms LaF¢TF VF and LaM¢TM VM give the total absorption in the fuel and mod­erator. However, in a homogeneous system, the fluxes in the fuel and moderator are the same-that is, ¢TF = ¢TM-SO that � = 1, and therefore LaFVF fhomo = -------LaF VF + LaM VM (6.121) It was shown earlier that � is greater than unity for a heterogeneous reactor. From a comparison of Eqs. (6.112) and (6.121), it follows that fhetero < fhomo. (6.122) The physical reason that f is smaller for the heterogeneous system than for its homogenized equivalent is that, in the heterogeneous case, as noted earlier, the flux is lower in the fuel than it is in the moderator. This depression in the flux is caused by the fact that some of the neutrons entering the fuel from the moderator are absorbed near the surface of the fuel, and they simply do not survive to contribute to the flux in its interior. The outer portion of the fuel thus shields the interior, and this state of affairs is known as self-shielding. What is a disadvantage for the thermal utilization, however, is necessarily an advantage as far as the resonance escape probability is concerned. Thus, al­though self-shielding decreases the absorption of thermal neutrons in the fuel, it also reduces the number of neutrons that are absorbed parasitically by resonance absorbers in the fuel. Therefore, it follows that the resonance escape probability for a heterogeneous system is larger than for the equivalent homogeneous mixture. Furthermore, since the average absorption cross-section of the fuel at resonance energies is much larger than the absorption cross-section at thermal energies, the

page number: 338
 text: 320 Nuclear Re actor Theory Chap. 6 depression in the flux of resonance neutrons is greater than it is for thermal neu­trons. As a consequence, the decrease in f for the heterogeneous system is more than offset by the increase in p. The fast fission factor for a heterogeneous reactor is also larger than for the homogeneous system, as may be seen in Fig. 6.10. This is because in the hetero­geneous case the fission neutrons pass through a region of pure fuel, where they are likely to induce fast fission before they encounter the moderator. The effect of heterogeneity is not as pronounced with E, however, as it is with f and p. In view of the fact that (fPhetero > (fphomo and it follows that koo for a heterogeneous reactor is greater than for its homogeneous equivalent. 10 This result is of considerable importance in the design of certain reac­tors. In particular, the maximum value of koo for a homogeneous mixture of natural uranium and graphite is only 0.85, and such a reactor cannot become critical. By lumping the fuel into a heterogeneous lattice, koo can be made sufficiently greater than unity that a critical reactor can be constructed using these materials. REFERENCES General Duderstadt, J.

Above this enrichment, p is of less overall importance in determining the value of kOCH and lumping the fuel tends to reduce the overall absorption of neutrons by the fissile material.
