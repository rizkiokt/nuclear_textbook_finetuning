 text: 9 Radiation Protection Since radiation is present in reactors and virtually every other device that utilizes nuclear energy, the designers of these systems must include radiation shielding where necessary for the protection of operating personnel and of the public at large. The responsibility for continuing surveillance of the facility can then be turned over to health physicists, 1 whose task it is to assure that no individual receives an un­ necessary or hazardous exposure to radiation. Criteria for the design of radiation shielding and for the establishment of a sound health physics program are based upon the effects of radiation on the human body. These effects, together with some of the calculations encountered in radiation problems, form the subject of this chap­ ter. Radiation shielding is discussed in Chapter 10. The literature of health physics contains many biological and medical terms that often confound the layman. In the present chapter, many of these terms are introduced in order to provide the reader with some of the background necessary to comprehend the more definitive literature in the field. A glossary of these terms is given at the end of the chapter. I Health physics is the name given to the study of problems related to the protection of man from exposure to radiation. That this term is inappropriate and misleading could not be clearer. Only a small part of what is involved in health physics can reasonably be called physics; at the same time, there are many more physics problems associated with health than those arising from exposure to radiation. 466

 text: Sec. 9.1 History of Radiation Effects 467 9.1 HISTORY OF RADIATION EFFECTS Throughout history, mankind has been exposed to various fonns of natural back­ ground radiation. However, these radiation levels were too low to suggest the dele­ terious effects of radiation, which did not become evident until the late 1800s, when the discovery of x-rays by Roentgen and of radioactivity by Becquerelled to the availability of high-intensity radiation sources. Soon after, many incidents of obvious radiation injury were reported. More subtle, long-tenn effects of radiation were recognized many years later. Radiation effects are usually divided into two categorie s, depending upon whether the damage arises from external exposure to radiation (i.e., to radiation incident on the body from the outside) or from internal exposure, due to radia­ tion emit ted from tadionuclides absorbed into the body. It was noted as early as 1890 that external exposure to x-rays can produce erythema (abnonnal redness of the skin), edema (swelling due to abnonnal accumulation of fluids) and epila­ tion (abnonnal loss of hair). By 1897, one investigator reported 69 cases of x-ray bums, as these injuries are called, and both Becquerel and Mme. Curie suffered similar bums from small tubes containing radioactive materials. The carcinogenic (cancer-inducing) effects of radiation were observed soon thereafter. By 1911, 94 cases of x-ray induced tumors were reported, 50 of these in radiologists (physicians who specialize in the use of radiation for various purposes), and by 1922, it was estimated that 100 radiologists had died as a result of radiation-induced cancer. Somewhat later, it was shown that the incidence of leukemia (roughly speaking, cancer of the blood-fonning organs, or the bone marrow) was significantly higher among radiologists than among other physicians. Evidence also accumula ted sug­ gesting that the average lifespan of radiologists was somewhat shorter than that of other physicians. Fortunately, recent studies of mortality in radiologists indicate that the increased incidence of leukemia and life shortening have disappeared. This is generally attributed to an increased awareness on the part of radiologists of the deleterious effects of radiation and to radiolog ists' adoption of improved radiation safety practices. It has long been known that the miners who worked in the cobalt mines of Saxony in southeastern Gennany and in the pitchblende mines in Czechoslo vakia, both of which contain large concentrations of uranium, suffered from a high inci­ dence of lung cancer (about 30 times the nonnal). Today, it is recognized that these workers were the victims of internal radiation exposure caused by the inhalation of the radioactive gas radon and its daughters, which are decay products of uranium released from the walls of the mine tunnels. The incidence of lung cancer is also substantially higher among uranium miners in the United States. Improved ventila­ tion of the mines and recently adopted rigid standards for the protection of miners is expected to eliminate this source of radiation injury.

 text: 468 Radiation Protection Chap. 9 A number of other cases of injury due to internal exposure have been reported over the years. From about 1915 to 1930, it was thought in some medical circles that radium and thorium had therapeutic value, and many unfortunate persons re­ ceived injections of tonics of these deadly substances. From about 1928 to 1945, a large number of persons were injected with suspensions of thorium dioxide, wh�ch was used as a contrast material for diagnostic x-rays. A significant increase in the.-.. incidence of cancer, especially cancer of the liver, was observed among this group. However, the most celebrated cases of internal exposure were those of radium­ dial painters at the US Radium Corporation in Orange, New Jersey. These women painted the numerals on watch dials with paint containing radium, and in order to obtain sharp numerals, they were in the habit of tipping their paint-laden brushes with their lips. The associated ingestion of radium led to the death, by various forms of cancer, of some 50 women out of a total of approximately 2,000 workers exposed. As a result of these and other tragic episodes in the use of x-rays and ra­ dioactive materials, a great deal is now known about the effects of radiation on the human species. The importance of safety in the utilization of radiation is now gen­ erally recognized, and, except for the use of radiation in medicine, strict standards of radiation exposure have been developed. This is fortunate, because so many of the devices of modern technology- accelerators , nuclear reactors, various radionu­ clide devices, television sets, high-flying airplanes, and space travel-all represent potential sources of radiation exposure. The nuclear industry, however, has con­ tributed very little in the way of radiation injury either to its own personnel or to the general public. As will be shown later in this chapter, the principal source of human exposure to radiation is from medical x-rays. 9.2 RADIATION UNITS To make meaningf ul calculations in radiation protection problems, it is necessary to have a set of units that allows radiation fields and radiation effects to be expressed quantitatively. Two systems of units are being used in the world today: the so­ called conventional system, which in various forms and refinements has been used for several decades, and the new Systeme International (Sf), which is gradually replacing the older system. This book, for the most part, will use conventional units, which are firmly imbedded in nuclear engineering practice and in governmental standards and regulations, at least in the United States. Radiation units are promulga ted by an international scientific body, the Inter­ national Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU).The discus­ sion that follows is based on ICRU report 19 (1971, the conventional system) and ICRU report 33 (1980, SI).

 text: Sec. 9.2 Radiation Units 469 Exposure The term exposure is used in the conventional system to describe a y-ray2 field incident on a body at any point. As discussed in Chapter 3, y-rays produce ions and electrons when they interact with air. The presence of y-rays at the surface of a body can therefore be measured in terms of the numbers of ions or electrons produced in the adjacent atmosphere. This measure of radiation field is especially reasonable in the context of radiation protection. As will be shown later, the bio­ logical effect of y-rays is a function of the ionization they produce in a body. Thus, the biological effects arising from a given exposure can be expected to increase more or less uniformly with exposure. Accordingly, the ICRU has defined exposure, which is given the symbol X, by the relation /).q X= ­/).m' (9.1) where /).q is the sum of the electrical charges on all the ions of one sign produced in air when all the electrons ( + and -), liberated by photons in a volume of air whose mass is /).m, are completely stopped in air. It should be noted that the electrons released from /).m need not, and in most cases do not, stop in the volume containing /).m. These electrons may actually travel a considerable distance from /).m. From Eq. (9.1) it is seen that exposure has dimensions of coullkg of air. The Roentgen The unit of exposure in the conventional system is the roentgen, abbreviated R, which is defined in the conventional system as 1 R = 2.58 x 10-4 coullkg, (9.2) which can be shown to be equivalent to the production of 1 electrostatic unit (l esu = 3.33 x 10-10 coul) of charge of one sign from the interaction of gamma radiation in 0.001293 g of air (l cm3 of air at 1 atmosphere pressure at O°C). One one-thous andth of a roentgen, a milliroentgen, is denoted as mR. In SI, the unit is the exposure unit, X. It is defined as the production of 1 coulomb of charge in 1 kg of air. One can show that 1 X unit == 3,876 R. 2 As in Chapter 3, x-rays and y-rays will both be referred to as y-rays.

page number: 488
 text: 470 Radiation Protection Chap. 9 Exposur e Rate The rate at which /).q in Eq. (9.1) is liberated as the result of interactions in /).m is called the exposure rate. This is written as X = dX/dt and has units of roentgens per unit time-for example, R/sec, mRlhr, etc. It must be emphasized that the concept of exposure and exposure rate applies only to y-rays (or x-rays) in air at a point outside a body. These tenns must not be used in a technical sense to describe neutrons or charged particles or interactions taking place within a body. It must also be remembered that these concepts and roentgen units of measurement are used only in the conventional system. They are not included in SI. Example 9.1 In a 1-mRlhr y-ray field, at what rate are ions being produced per cm3/sec? Solution. Only singly charged ions are usually produced when y-rays interact in air. The charge on each ion is therefore the electronic charge 1.60 x 10-19 coul. Since 1 R releases 2.58 x 10-4 coul/kg, this is equivalent to 2.58 x 10-4/1.60 x 10-19 = 1.61 X 1015 ions/kg = 1.61 x 1012 ions/g, and so 1 mR produces 1.61 x 109 ions/g. There are 0.001293 g/cm3 of air, so that in 1 cm3, 1.61 x 109 x 0.001293 = 208 x 106 ions are produced. If the exposure rate is 1 mRlhr, these ions are formed at a rate of 2.08 X 106/3,600 = 578 ions/cm3-sec. [Ans.] Imparted Energy It will be shown later that the biological effect of radiation is a function of how much energy is deposited in a body. Consider, therefore , a volume /). V containing the mass /).m of any substance. Let Ein and Eout be the sum of the kinetic ener­ gies of all particles-photons, neutrons, or charged particles-incident upon and emerging from /). V, respectively. In the case of photons, Ein and Eout are their to­ tal energies as given by Eq. (2.13). The imparted energy, /).ED, is defined by the fonnula /).ED = Ein -Eout + Q, (9.3) where Q is the sum of the Q-values of whatever (if any) nuclear reactions that take place within /). V It is necessary to include Q in defining /). ED, because the concept of imparted energy is intended to reflect the deposition of energy that is available for producing biological effects, and nuclear reactions may increase the

 text: Sec. 9.2 Radiation Units 471 deposited energy, since one effect of the reaction is merely to the masses of atomic nuclei, but this is not a biologically significa nt process. Absorbed Dose The absorbed dose to the mass fl.m, denoted by D, is defined as the imparted energy per unit mass. In symbols, fl.ED D= -­fl.m (9.4) The absorbed dose at a point is the limit of Eq. (9.4) as fl.m approaches zero. The conventional unit of absorbed dose is the rad. One rad, which is the acronym for radiation absorbed dose, is equal to an absorbed dose of 0.01 joule/kg; that is, 1 rad = 0.01 J/kg = 100 ergs/g. (9.5) A millirad, 0.001 rad, is abbreviated mrad. The SI unit of absorbed dose is called the gray, abbreviated Gy. This is de­ fined as an absorbed dose of 1 joule/kg; that is, 1 Gy = 1 J/kg. In view of the definition of the rad, it follows that 1 Gy = 100 rads. A milligray is abbreviated mGy. Absorbed Dose Rate (9.6) (9.7) The absorbed dose rate, the rate at which an absorbed dose is received, is denoted by D. In conventional units, it is measured in rad/sec, mrad/hr, etc., and in SI units, in Gy/sec, mGy/hr, etc. Kerma Another concept that is widely encountered, especially in connection with calcu­ lations involving fast neutrons, is that of kerma, denoted by K. Kenna is defined as the sum of the initial kinetic energies of all charged, ionizing particles released by indirectly ionizing radiation (mostly neutrons) per unit mass of substance. The energy absorbed in a material due to the attenuation of neutrons is often specified as the kenna or kenna dose. The units of K are the same as those of D, namely, rads, or ergs/gram, for the conventional system and grays, or joules/Kg, for the SI system. Kerma has more utility in and of itself; however, it is easier both to measure and compute kenna than it is dose, which is the real quantity of inter­ est. Fortunately, the two can be shown to be virtually equal in a wide variety of situation s.

 text: 472 Radiation Protection Chap. 9 Relative Biological Effectiveness It would certainly simplify matters if the biological effect of radiation was directly proportional to the energy deposited by radiation in an organism. In this case, the absorbed dose would be a suitable measure of biological injury, regardless of the nature of the incident radiation or its energy. Unfortunately, the actual situation is considerably more complicated. Biological effects depend not only on the total energy deposited per gram or per cm3, but also on the way in which this energy is distributed along the path of the radiation. In particular, the biological effect of any radiation increases with the LET (see Section 3.9) of the radiation. Thus, for the same absorbed dose, the biological damage from high LET radiation, a-particles, or neutrons is much greater than from low LET radiation, fJ-rays or y-rays. This result is not surprising, on the basis of a number of radiochemical obser­ vations. It has been found, for example, that when 210Pb a-particles (5.3 MeV) are absorbed by a solution of ferrous sulfate, 1.5 molecules of free H2 are fonned per 100 eV absorbed in the solution. By contrast, 60Co y-rays (1.17 and 1.33 MeV) produce only 0.4 H2 molecules per 100 e V absorbed in the same solution. Since radiation-induced changes in chemical systems are not solely a function of en­ ergy absorption, radiation-induced effects in biological systems could hardly be expected to be so. The tenn quality is used to describe the fact that energy may be deposited by radiation along its track in different ways. Radiations of different types or energies are said to differ in quality. The fact that radiations of different types or energies, in general, give dif­ ferent biological effects for the same absorbed dose is described in terms of a factor known as the relative biological effectiveness (RBE). This quantity is deter­ mined in the following type of experiment. A tissue or organ is first irradiated with 200-KeV y-rays, whose RBE is arbitrarily taken to be unity, and the resulting ef­ fect is observed for a given absorbed do se. The experiment is now repeated with another fonn of radiation. If, in this case, it is found that the same biological effect, whatever that may be, occurs with only one-tenth the previous absorbed dose, then the second type of radiation is evidently 10 times more effective than the y-rays per absorbed dose, and its RBE is taken to be 10. It must be emphasized that there is no one RBE for a given type or energy of radiation. The RBE depends on the tissue, the biological effect under consideration, the dose, and, in some cases, also the dose rate. The RBE is now used almost exclusively in radiobiology, but it is considered to be too detailed and too specific a parameter to be used for ordinary radiation protection purposes. Quality Factor and Radiation Weighting Factor To take into account the differences in biological effect of different radiations and at the same time to simplify radiation protection calculations, the quality factor

This parameter is a somewhat arbitrary approximation to RBE values as a function of the linear energy transfer. In contrast to the RBE, which is always determined by experiment, Q is simply assigned, but, of course, after consideration of RBE values. The quality factor as a function of LET is given in Table 9.1; values of Q for various radiations are given in Table 9.2. The radia­ tion weighting factor, symbolized by W R, is related to the type and energy of the incident radiation. It is approximately equal to the average quality factor Q.

 text: 474 Radiation Protection Chap. 9 Equivalent Dose The equivalent dose, denoted by H, is defined as the product of the absorbed dose and the radiation weighting factor W R; that is H(equivalent dose) = D(absorbed dose) x WR(radiation weighting factor). (9.8) The equivalent dose is also loosely called the biological dose (fonnerly it was called the RBE dose) and differs from the dose-equivalent H for tissues or or­ gans. According to the NCRP,3 the equivalent dose is an average absorbed dose in the specific tissue or organ weighted by the radiation weighting factor. The dose­ equivalent is the absorbed dose at a point in tissue weighted by a quality factor detennined from the LET of the radiation at that point. Because weighting factors are, in effect, simplified versions of the RBE, it is clear that the equal equivalent doses from different sources of radiation, delivered to any tissue in the body, should produce more or less the same biological effect. This does not mean, of course, that a given equivalent dose produces the same effects in different parts of the body. It will be shown in the next section that a dose to the hand, for example, may have quite a different (and less serious) effect than the same dose to the blood-fonning organs. The US NRC uses the tenn dose-equivalent, which is also symbolized by the symbol H. The conventional unit of equivalent dose is the rem and is used by the NRC.4 If the quality factor is unity, as it is for y-rays, then an absorbed dose of 1 rad gives a dose-equivalent of 1 rem. With a-particles whose Q is 20, 1 rad of absorbed dose results in a dose-equivalent of 20 rems. A millirem is written mrem. The SI unit of dose is the sievert, abbreviated Sv. This is the dose-equivalent arising from an absorbed dose of I gray. Since 1 Gy = 100 rads, it follows that I Sv = 100 rem. (9.9) A millisievert is abbreviated mSv. The dose-equivalent or equivalent dose is usually referred to simply as dose. Equivalent Dose Rate The rate at which equivalent dose is received is denoted by if. This is detennined from the absorbed dose rate by 3NCRP report No. 116, 1993. 4This is the acronym for roentgen equivalent man, although this identification is not encour­ aged, since the roentgen is now a unit of exposure, not dose.

page number: 493
 text: Sec. 9.2 Radiation Units 475 (9.10) and is expressed as Sv/h, Sv/sec, etc. Dose equivalent rate is also denoted by H. Like equivalent dose rate, this is detennined from the absorbed dose rate by H=DxQ and is expressed in rem/sec, mremlhr, etc. Example 9.2 It can be shown that a beam of 1 MeV y-rays having an intensity of 105 y-rays/cm2- sec deposits in tissue approximately 5 x 10-3 ergs/g-sec. Calculate the absorbed dose rate and the dose-equivalent rate. Solution. It takes a deposition of 100 ergs/g-sec, to give 1 rad/sec, so the absorbed dose rate is here b = 5 X 10-3/100 = 5 x 10-5 rad/sec = 5 x 10-7 Gy/sec. This is a small number and is better written as b = 5 X 10-5 x 3,600 = 0.180 rad/hr = 180 rnrad/hr = 1.80 mGy/hr. [Ans.] From Table 9.2, Q = 1 for y-rays, and it follows that iI = 180 rnrem/hr = 1.80 mSv/hr. [Ans.] Population Dose Frequently, it is useful to specify the total dose-equivalent to a given group of people. This is called the population dose,s denoted as Hpop. The units of Hpop are man-rems, or person-rems, and in SI units are person-sieverts. Calculations of Hpop are carried out in an obvious way. Thus, if in some nuclear incident a town of 2,000 people is exposed to radiation in such a way that one-half receives 2 rems, while the other half receives 1 rem, the population dose is Hpop = 1,000 x 2 + 1,000 x 1 = 3000 man-rem = 30 person-sie vert. To generalize this procedure, let N(H)dH be the number of persons in a total population N who receive doses between Hand d H. Then, 5The term collection dose is frequently used instead of population dose, because of the possi­ ble misinterpretation of the latter to infer an average, or mean, dose to the population.

 text: 476 Radiation Protection Chap. 9 N = {XO N(H)dH. The population dose is the integral over the number of people who receive a given dose mUltiplied by that dose; that is, Hpop = {XO N(H)H dH. (9.11) 9.3 SOME ELEMENTARY BIOLOGY In the last analysis, the effect of radiation on living things is due to the excitation or ionization of various molecules contained in the cells that make Up a living system. Before pursuing these matters further, it is appropriate to review some elementary biology of cells, especially human cells. There are approximately 4 x 1013 cells in the average adult person. These are not all identical, however, either in function or in size. Brain cells obviously perform a different function than liver cells. Most cells are quite small, on the order of 10-3 cm in diameter; nerve cells, by contrast, may be a meter long. Cells are divided into two broad classes: somatic cells and germ cells. Almost all of the cells in the body are somatic cells. These are the cells that make up the organs, tissues, and other body structures. The germ cells, which are also called ga­ metes, function only in reproduction. It is the union of gametes from different sexes that is the starting point of a new individual. The gametes also carry the hereditary material of the species that makes children look more like their parents than their neighbors, and ensures that the foibles of humanity pass with little change from generation to generation. Modem research has shown that the living cell is an enormously complex system. A typical somatic cell of the kind found in animals is shown in Fig. 9.1. Cells contain a number of organlike structures called organelles, each of which performs specific functions for the cell as the organs do in the body as a whole. These organelles are suspended in the cytoplasm, a transparent, dilute mixture of water and various molecules and electrolytes, which comprises the bulk of the cell volume. Other major parts of the cell shown in Fig. 9.1 are as follows: Nucleus. This is the large, generally spherical body that functions as the control center of the cell; it contains the chromatin. Chromatin. This is the genetic material of the cell.

This organelle's functions are not entirely understood. The Golgi apparatus apparently concentrates and modifies certain chemical sub­ stances. Lysosomes and peroxisomes. These organelles contain enzymes for producing various chemicals.

 text: 478 Radiation Protection Chap. 9 Mitochondria (singular, mitochondr ion). These objects (there may be several thousand in one cell) are responsible for the metabolism of the cell. Centrioles. These organelles occur in pairs and are essential in mitosis, or cell division. Ribosomes. These are the centers for the production of proteins; they are located on the endoplasmic reticulum, on the surface of the nucleus, and in the cyto­ plasm. The genetic material in a cell is called the chromatin only during the quies­ cent period of a cell (i.e., when the cell is not dividing). At that time, it appears as a confused mass of strands of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules, along with certain nuclear proteins. In this stage, the chromatin controls the synthesis of the proteins that gives the cell its distinctive characteri stics. With the onset of mito­ sis, these strands become untangled and coil into a fixed number of bundles called chromosomes. The number of chromosomes varies from species to species; in man, there are 46 chromosomes in every cell, except in the germ cells, which contain only half this number. In mitosis, each chromosome exactly duplicates itself, so that each newly formed cell acquires a full complement of 46 chromosomes. Since the chromosomal DNA controls the production of cell protein, the two new cells develop into replicas of the original cell. Following mitosis, the chromosomes un­ coil and return to their former tangled state. It is important to note, however, that although in this stage the individual chromosomes cannot be distinguished, they still exist as specific entities. The chromatin, in short, is composed of uncoiled chromosomes, not disintegrated chromosomes. Cell division occurs at more or less fixed time intervals over the life of the cell. The interval between successive divisions is called the mitotic cycle time. The cell cycle is further divided into three other intervals, as illustrated in Fig. 9.2. In M S (DNA synthesis) Figure 9.2 The mitotic cycle of a cell.

page number: 497
 text: Sec. 9.4 The Biological Effects of Radiation 479 the figure, M is the time during which mitosis is taking place. During the interval S, at the middle of the cycle, DNA is synthesized in the nucleus. The intervals G1 and G2 are known as gaps in the cycle. The cell nucleus is relatively inactive at these times. In lung and ovarian cells of newborn hamsters, which are commonly used in radiobiological experiments, M = I hr, S = 6 hrs, G 1 = 1 hr and G2 = 3 hrs. The total cycle time is therefore 11 hrs. Cells from other animals and tissues have different cycle times. In the basal stem cells of the human intestine, the mitotic cycle time is about 24 hrs. On the other hand, nerve and muscle cells, for example, are highly differentiated; they have long lifetimes and essentially never undergo mitosis. The structure of germ cells is much different from that of somatic cells and will not be discussed here. In any case, there are two varieties of germ cells. These are called, respectively, sperm cells and egg cells, or ova (singular, ovum). The former are produced in the testes of the male, the latter in the ovaries of the female. Collectively, the testes and ovaries are called gonads. In reproduction, the union of a sperm and an ovum, each with 23 chromosomes, produces a zygote, the first bona fide cell of the new individual. The zygote contains 46 chromosomes. The mitosis of the zygote and its progeny eventually produces a full-size offspring. For many years, it was thought that hereditary characteri stics stem from the actions of individual genes, which were pictured as particle-like entities strung along the chromosomes. It is now known that the genes are actually segments of DNA molecules that provide a kind of code controlling the synthesis of proteins. Nevertheless, the term gene is still used to describe the point of origin of recogniz­ able characteri stics, and changes in the chromosomes that result in new, inheritable characteri stics are called gene mutations. 9.4 THE BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF RADIATION It is usual to divide the biological effects of radiation into two broad classes, de­ pending upon whether the effects are inherently stochastic6 or nonstochastic in nature. Stochastic effects are those whose probability of occurrence, as opposed to severity, are determined by dose. Cancer and genetic mutations are examples of stochastic effects. As discussed next, there is a definite probability that cancer will result from a given radiation dose, but it is by no means certain that cancer will re­ sult from that dose. Furthermore, the ultimate magnitude or severity of the cancer is unrelated to the original dose-it is determined by events and circumstances that occur long after the initiating event. With stochastic processes, there is no reason 6Stochastic is a general term referring to events or processes that are determined by a proba­ bility or a sequence of probabilities.

page number: 498
 text: 480 Radiation Protection Chap. 9 to suppose that there is some level of radiation below which no effect is possible. Presumably, any dose, however small, is capable of initiating a stochastic effect. Nonstochastic, or deterministic, effects of radiation are entirely predictable, and their severity is an inevitable consequence of a given dose. Examples of non­ stochastic effects are nonmalignant skin damage (erythema), the fonnation of cataracts (opaqueness of the lens of the eye), hematological effects (changes in the composition of the blood), and so on. Such non stochastic processes may re­ quire some sort of a threshold dose before they become manifest, as in the case of cataract fonnation. But, whether there is a threshold or not, the severity of the injury ultimately increases with the level of the dose. Mechanisms of Radiation Effects Because the cell is such a complex system, there can be no single effect of ra­ diation, even at the cellular level. Whatever effects do occur necessarily depend upon which organelles are involved and on their importance to the functioning of the cell. There are two fundamental mechanisms by which radiation can affect an organelle. First, radiation may lead to the breakage of molecules, rupturing their bonds by the ionizing effect of the radiation. This is known as the direct effect of radiation. Second, radiation, again because of its ionizing power, may result in the production of new chemicals, such as the highly reactive oxy (0) and hydroxyl (OH) radicals, which interact chemically within the cell. This is called an indirect effect of radiation. Recent experimental evidence suggests that the indirect effect is more important by far in producing biological effects. In any event, it is important to recognize that both processes are fundamentally chemical in nature-a broken molecule is necessarily two other molecules. The biological effects of radiation are therefore not essentially different from the biological effects of various chem­ icals. Radiation is merely a different and seemingly bizarre means for producing the chemicals in question. The end result of these chemical transformati ons on a cell depends upon which cellular molecules are affected. The detai ls of these processes are not en­ tirely understood at the present time. Nevertheless, there is overwhelming evidence that, with respect to observable stochastic and nonstochastic effects, the most sensi­ tive portion of the cell lies within the cell nucleus, probably with the chromosomes. Other organelles can be affected by radiation, of course. If one of the larger molec­ ular structures in a mitochondrion is damaged, for instance, the functioning of this organelle can be disrupted. However, because there are many mitochondria in most cells, the malfunctioning of one of these structures would normally have no observ­ able effect on the overall behavior of the cell. But events taking place within the nucleus are crucial to the well-being of the cell as a whole and may be transmitted to the cell progeny in mitosis.

This is usually done in flat, shallow containers called petri dishes, which contain a suitable culture medium. When such colonies are exposed to radiation over a short period (i.e., when they are given acute doses of radiation), a fraction of the exposed cells cease to reproduce and eventually disintegrate. In this event, the cells are said to have been killed by the radiation; more accurately, they have suffered from what is called reproductive death. When the fraction of surviving cells is plotted versus the radiation dose, sur­ vival curves like those shown in Fig. 9.3 are obtained. In all cases, the surviving fraction decreases with increases in the absorbed dose, as would be expected. How­ ever, as indicated in the figure, there is a marked difference for a given absorbed dose between the survival fractions with high and low LET radiation. With high LET radiation, the fraction of surviving cel ls drops sharply (exponenti ally), but with low LET radiation the survival curve exhibits some flatness or "shoulder" at low doses and only drops steeply at high doses. A precise explanation of cell survival curves is not possible at the present time. It is clear, of course, that the effect of high LET radiation is greater than 10-1 10-2 10-3 �--�----�----�--�----�--� o 200 400 600 Rads 800 1000 1200 Figure 9.3 Survival curves for cells exposed to acute doses of radiation.

 text: 482 Radiation Protection Chap. 9 that of low LET radiation per absorbed dose, which is another way of saying that the RBE is larger for high LET radiation. The existence of the shoulder with low LET radiation at low doses suggests the existence of some sort of threshold for this type of radiation, possibly due to repair mechanisms within the cell that are overwhelmed at high doses. At least it is clear that dose-effect relationship is far less direct at low doses than at high doses. These general characteri stics of high and low LET radiation are found in virtually all data involving the biological effects of radiation. It will be recalled from the preceding section that cells have a natural mitotic cycle during which various activities occur at specified times. Using a number of sophistica ted techniques, biologists can produce colonies of cells whose cycles are all in phase. That is, all of the cells undergo mitosis at the same time, DNA produc­ tion at the same time, and so on. Such cells or colonies are said to be synchronous. When synchronous cells are irradiated at various points in their mitotic cycles, it is found that the effect of the radiation, both high LET and low LET, is somewhat more pronounced just before or during mitosis. Cells irradiated at other points in the cycle tend to survive the effect of radiation exposure until the onset of mitosis, when they fail to reproduce and die a reproductive death. The experiments with synchronous cells account for the phenomenon of ra­ diosensitivity, which is observed for both stochastic and nonstochastic effects of radiation on whole organisms, including man. Thus, certain tissues, namely, those whose cells reproduce most frequently, are normally the most sensitive to radiation. These cells often die when they attempt mitosis; if they survive mitosis, they may be sensitized for the later induction of cancer. Such radiosensitive tissues include the red blood marrow, which continually produces new blood cells, and the tissue beneath the lining of the gastrointestinal tract that contains the stem cells that con­ tinually replace the lining of the tract. By contrast, the more static tissues-muscle and bone, for example-are far more immune to the effects of radiation. The foregoing remarks, especially with regard to the radiosensitive tissues, relate only to the body after birth. Prior to birth, or in utero, all of the fetal tissues are undergoing rapid development, and for this reason, they are particularly sen­ sitive to radiation. This is especially the case during the embryonic period, from fertilization through about the eighth week. Cell killing, which is clearly a nonstochastic process, accounts for the clinical effects (i.e., the gross medical effects) that are observed following acute exposure of individuals to radiation. These effects, described in detail in the next section, depend on how many cells are killed and on the normal function or purpose of the cells. Consider, for example, the irradiation of the intestine s. The lining of the in­ testine is continually renewed by the multiplica tion of cells just beneath the lining surface. When the intestine is exposed to y-rays, the rate of production of these

page number: 501
 text: Sec. 9.4 The Biological Effects of Radiation 483 cells is slowed. Up to moderate radiation doses, enough new cells are formed to maintain the intestinal wall. However, at high doses, the surface cannot be main­ tained, and it disintegrates. As a consequence, various body fluids enter the in­ testines, while bacterial and toxic materials from the intestine pass into the blood stream. The overall effect on the individual is diarrhea, dehydrati on, infection and toxemia (blood poisoning ). As this example shows, total-body involvement results from events at the cellular level. Cancer Cancer is the second-ranking cause of death in the world today. In the United States, approximately 38% of the population contracts the disease, and 17% suc­ cumbs to it. Of the 275 million people living in this country in 2000, about 47 million of them will die of cancer if cancer mortality rates do not change. Current mortality rates for various types of cancer in the United States are given in Table 9.3. Cancer is not now viewed as a single disease, but rather as about one hun­ dred closely related diseases, all characterized by rapid, uncontrolled cell division. There are a thousand or more chemicals, called carcinogens, that are known to produce cancer. More than 90 percent of all human cancers are believed to be the result of carcinogens in the environment, the bulk of which are naturally occurring, not man-made. Since various chemicals can produce cancer, it is not surprising that radiation is also capable of doing so, in view of the underlying mechanism of radiobiological effects described earlier.

 text: 484 Radiation Protection Chap. 9 Radiation-induced cancers are no different from cancers arising from other causes. The extent of the cancer-inducing effect of radiation must therefore be de­ duced from the (often small) increase in the observed incidence of cancer in groups of persons exposed to radiation. This is especially difficult at low doses where the effect, if it exists at all, may be hidden in statistical fluctuations. The precise causes of cancer are not known as of this writing. There is, how­ ever, increasing evidence that cancer induction is a two-stage process. In the first, or initiation, stage, a lesion (i.e., some injury or other deleterious effect) is produced in DNA in one or a number of cells. The affected cells are thereby transformed into potentially cancerous cells, poised to undergo uncontrolled division. However, they are prevented from doing so by some as yet unidentified honnonal, immuno­ logic, or other protective agent. Such agents are probably inherited characteri stics of every individual. During the second, or promotion, stage, the protective mechanism goes awry for some reason and pennits the initiated cells to multiply without restraint. Pre­ sumably, the promotion stage can be triggered by such diverse factors as viral in­ fections, chemical irritants, failure of the immunological system, or physiological changes in the body that occur naturally with aging. The two-state theory of cancer explains the fact that there is a Latent period of several years between the time of irradiation and the appearance of many types of cancers, during which the probability of a cancer occurring is essentially zero. It also accounts for the fact that cancer seems to run in families; that is, it is to some extent an inherited trait. This also implies, of course, that there may be seg­ ments of the population that are especially susceptible to radiation-induced cancer, a circumst ance that has only recently been recognized. Similarly, there are prob­ ably segments of the population that are especially resistant to cancer induced by radiation. It should be noted that the cell or cells triggered into malignancy during the promotion stage generally are not the same cells initiated during irradiation. Rather, they are progeny of the original cells, often many generations removed. It is clear, therefore , that whatever initiating character is conferred on the irradiated cell must necessarily be carried from generation to generation. Again this speaks of a chro­ mosomal origin of cancer. Genetic Effects If radiation succeeds in disrupting a DNA molecule in a chromosome, the result may be a muta tion. If this mutation occurs in a somatic cell of a fully developed individual, no macroscopic effect may be observed unless a great many cells are similarly involved. This is because the DNA detennines the structure of the proteins manufactured by the cell, and a mutation thus interferes with the production of the proteins necessary for proper cellular functioning. As a result, mutations are

page number: 503
 text: Sec. 9.5 Quantitative Effects of Radiation on the Human Species 485 usually harmful to cells, and the progeny of a mutant cell, if not the parent cell itself, simply die out. If the mutation occurs in a germ cell, the affected cell is usually incapable of being fertilized. However, if the mutant gamete is successfully fertilized and the zygote develops into a live offspring, then the mutation is carried into the progeny. For this reason, radiation exposure to the gonads is of special concern, at least through the breeding age. Mutations occur spontaneously in the human population from unknown causes. Indeed, about 10% of all newborn infants either suffer directly from a dis­ order or malfunction of genetic origin or carry such defects, which are expressed later in life or in their progeny. Such defects can be as obvious as albinism (con­ genital deficiency in skin pigment) and Down's syndrome (mongoloid features and associated mental retardation caused by the presence of an extra chromosome), or so slight that they can only be detected by laboratory tests. Radiation-induced genetic defects are no different from those normal to the species. The effect of radiation is therefore to increase the naturally occurring mutation rate. 9.5 QUANTITATIVE EFFECTS OF RADIATION ON THE HUMAN SPECIES A considerable effort has been made over the years to determine the effects of radi­ ation on the human body. Since it is not possible to perform radiation experiments on people, current knowledge of radiation effects is based on data from radiation accidents and overexposures of the types discussed in Section 9.1; on epidemio­ logicaF studies of radiation-induced diseases such as leukemia and lung cancer; on studies of the casualties and survivors of World War II atomic bombings in Japan; and on numerous experiments with laboratory animals. The current status of these studies may be summarized as follows: a) There is well-documented information on the effects of large, acute (short­ term) radiation doses, in excess of 10 to 20 rems. b) Because the effects are so rare, if they exist at all, there is only limited data showing positive effects of i) acute doses up to 10 or 20 rems and not repeated; ii) acute doses of a few rems and repeated occasionally; and iii) chronic (continuin g for a long time) doses of the order of millirems per day. Only categories (a) and (b-iii) will be considered here, as these are the most important to nuclear engineers. Large acute doses may be received accidentally at 7 Epidemiology is the study of epidemics, diseases afflicting large numbers of persons.

 text: 486 Radiation Protection Chap. 9 a nuclear installation, while the low doses in the second category may be the rule at such facilities. Large Acute Doses: Early Effects In discussing the effects of acute doses, it is usual to distinguish between early effects, which are evident within 60 days of the exposure, and late effects, which become evident after 60 days. Early effects are generally nonstochastic in nature; late effects arise from both stochastic and nonstochastic processes. Table 9.4 shows the average clinical early effects observed following acute whole-body doses up to the order of 1,000 rems. It will be noted that no serious deleterious effects are nonnally seen for doses of less than about 75 rems. At doses larger than 75 rems, the exposed individual is said to suffer from acute radiation syndrome, or ARS, as it is known in medical circles. All of the symptoms listed in the table are the result of simultaneous damage to several body organs resulting, in tum, from injuries to individual cells as discussed in the preceding section. The incidence of death given in Table 9.4 is for individuals who have not undergone treatment. In this case, fatalities begin to be observed with acute doses TABLE 9.4 PROBABLE EARLY EFFECTS OF ACUTE WHOLE-BODY RADIATION DOSES*t Acute dose (rems) 5 to 75 75 to 200 200 to 600 600 to 1,000 Probable observed effect Chromosomal aberrations and temporary depression of white blood cell levels in some individuals. No other observable effects. Vomiting in 5 to 50% of exposed individuals within a few hours, with fatigue and loss of appetite. Moderate blood changes. Recovery within a few weeks for most symptoms. For doses of 300 rems or more, all exposed individuals will exhibit vomiting within 2 hours. Severe blood changes, with hemorrhage and increased susceptibility to infection, particularly at the higher doses. Loss of hair after 2 weeks for doses over 300 rems. Recovery from 1 month to a year for most individuals at the lower end of the dose range; only 20% survive at the upper end of the range. Vomiting within 1 hour. Severe blood changes, hemorrhage, infection, and loss of hair. From 80% to 100% of exposed individuals will succumb within 2 months; those who survive will be convalescent over a long period. *The whole-body doses given in this table are those measured in soft tissue near the body surface; because of energy absorption in the body, the interior (or vertical midline) doses, which are sometimes quoted, are about 70% of the values in the table. tFrom S.

Persons who receive medical treatment have a some­ what better chance of survival; fatalities in this group begin to occur at about 500 rems. The whole-body acute dose that leads, without therapy, to the death of 50% of an exposed group within T days of exposure is called the LDso/ T dose.8 For example, an LDso/60 dose will kill one-half of an exposed population in 60 days. The LDso/60 for man is not known accurately, but is thought to be approximately 340 rems. For most mammals it is about the same value. Bacteria and adult insects, by contrast, have an LDso/60 on the order of 10,000 rads. In the range of doses from about 100 to 1,000 rems, the most important ef­ fects are those associated with the blood, or more properly, the blood-forming or­ gans, especially the red bone marrow. The patient in this case is said to exhibit hematopoietic syndrome. Human blood consists of three formed elements: (1) red blood cells, or ery­ throcytes, (2) white blood cells, or leukocytes, and (3) platelets, all of which are suspended in a fluid called plasma. The red cells carry oxygen, which is necessary for life, through the body. The white cells consist of several different types of cells, the most populous of which are the polymorphonuclear neutrophils (50%-75%) and the lymphocytes (20%-40%). Among other functions they perform, the white cells act to repel or reduce infection in the body. The platelets play an essential role in the clotting of blood . The normal range of concentrations of the formed elements of blood (i.e., the normal blood count) is given in Table 9.5. Following acute whole-body irradiation, the blood count changes; the extent depends on how large a dose was received. Fig­ ure 9.4 shows a typical blood-count history following an acute dose of 300 rems. Because of the drop in the number of leukocytes, the resistance of the exposed in­ dividual to infection is lowered. At the same time, the fall in platelet count prevents normal clotting of the blood, which, in severe cases, may lead to hemorrhage, or profuse bleeding. It should be pointed out that with the exception of the lymphocytes, which are unusually sensitive to radiation, the other formed elements of blood are fairly 8LD stands for "lethal dose."

Treatment for a patient suffering from hematopoietic syndrome includes isolation in a sterile environment, the adminis­ tration of antibiotics, and bone-marrow transplants. An acute whole-body dose of between about 1,000 and 5,000 rem leads to what is known as the gastrointestinal syndrome. In this case, the dominant effect and ultimate cause of death is failure of the intestinal wall due to depletion of its stem cells as described iIi the preceding section. The patient remains in satisfactory condition for a few days while the existing wall cells continue to function, but as these are sloughed off, the patient succumbs to infection. The exposed individual usually dies within two weeks. 10 Persons who receive doses in excess of 5,000 rems die within a few hours of exposure. The cause of death is not entirely clear, but probably involves the rapid accumulation of fluid in the brain. These symptoms are known as central nervous system syndrome. 9This is due, at least in part, to the fact that erythrocytes and platelets have no nUclei. They are bodies contained in the blood, but are not cells in the ordinary sense of the teffil. IODeath from the gastrointestinal syndrome beginning in the neighborhood of 1,000 rerns requires simultaneous failure of the blood-foffiling organs, which occurs with whole-body irradiation at this level and removes an important mechanism for fighting infection. With irradiation of the intestines alofle, the onset of death begins around 2,000 ferns with and LDso/60 of about 3,500 rems.

 text: Sec. 9.5 Quantitative Effects of Radiation on the Human Species 489 The preceding discussion refers to whole-body irradiation. If only a portion of the body is exposed, the resulting early effects depend upon which portion is ir­ radiated, although it may be said in general that the accompanying injury is always less severe, because fewer interacting organs and systems are involved. However, the exposure may result in serious late effects of the type to be described shortly. For example, a hand receiving an absorbed dose of 200 to 300 rads of x-rays will exhibit only erythema similar to mild sunburn. More serious bums, comparable to scalding or to chemical bums, occur with doses of thousands of rads. Although in both cases the affected region will heal, it becomes predisposed to the later devel­ opment of skin cancer. Large Acute Doses: Late Effects There are considerable data showing late radiation effects in persons who receive a large acute whole-body dose at least once in their lifetime. Space permits only a brief summary of each effect. Cancer After an acute radiation dose, there is generally a period when there is no apparent increase in the probability of incurring cancer. The length of the latent period depends on the age at which irradiation occurs and the ultimate site of the malignancy. The latent period is followed by an interval, called the plateau, where the risk of a cancer is approximately constant. Here, the term risk is defined quantitatively as the number of cases of cancer to be expected per year following irradiation per million man-rems of dose. Beyond the plateau period, the risk of cancer drops essentially to zero. A simplified model of cancer risk is depicted i� Fig. 9.5. Table 9.6 lists the lengths of the latent period and plateau for various tissues and gives the corresponding risk values (risk coefficients) . ......

Further explanation is necessary regarding the risk coefficients in Table 9.6. Data on human exposure to acute radiation doses above 1 00 rem indicate that the excess incidence of cancer, corrected for cell-killing early effects, increases ap­ proximately linearly with doses for both low LET and high LET radiation. A plot of the excess cancer incidence versus dose, called the dose-response curve, is there­ fore a straight line at high doses, as shown in Fig. 9.6. At lower doses, the data on human exposure are much less conclusive, and the relation of cancer incidence to dose is inferred for the most part from experiments with laboratory animals. Until recently there was an absence of human data at low doses. Hence, the traditional practice has been to extrapolate the dose-response curve linearly to a zero dose, as indicated in the figure. This procedure is referred to as the linear hypothesis. It is generally agreed that such an extrapolation is proper for high LET radiation. For low LET radiation, there is considerable evidence to suggest that a linear extrapolation overestimates the carcinogenic effects of low doses, and that the actual dose-response curve may lie below the extrapolated curve, as shown in Fig. 9.6. This issue has not been settled a.s of this writing and is the subject of considerable debate. 11 11 Arguments supporting different varieties of dose-effect curves are discussed later in this chapter and are presented in the BEIR III and V reports and in the references at the end of the chapter.

Acute dose Cell killing Figure 9.6 Dose-response curves for acute radiation doses. 491 The values of risk given in Table 9.6 are based on the linear hypothesis. Cal­ culations using these values may very well exaggerate the effects of radiation ex­ posure at low doses. In any case, Table 9.6 probably provides an upper boundary for estimating the consequences of radiation accidents. Calculations of this sort are described in the next section. Mutations Genetic effects of radiation exposure in man have not been demonst rated at the present time. In lieu of human data, the genetic risk of radia­ tion for people is estimated from data on laboratory mice. Several significant facts emerge from these data. First, the male mouse is considerably more sensitive to the genetic effects of radiation than the female. Exposure of male mice at high dose rates produces many more mutations per rem than does the same dose at lower rates; in other words, a given dose does more damage if delivered over a shorter period. Thus, damage to genetic material is clearly repairable. But the data also suggest that the most radiogenetically sensitive portions of the male mouse are the spermatozoa and their precursor spermatids, which survive as individual entities over only a small fraction of the reproductive cycle. Because the same is true in man, this implies that the transmission of genetic damage from acute doses of ra­ diation can be reduced by delaying conception until new sperm cells have matured from cells in a less sensitive stage at the time of exposure. The basis for quantitative estimates of the genetic affects of radiation on the human species is complica ted and beyond the scope of this book. (The reader should consult the references at the end of the chapter; see, in particular, the re­ ports of the National Academy of Scienc es.) In any event, it is usual to divide such

page number: 510
 text: 492 Radiation Protection Chap. 9 effects into the following four broad classes, each of which gives rise to one or more clinically observable human defects: a) Single-gene disorders arising from a mutation at a specific point on a chro­ mosome. b) Multifactorial disorders due to multiple point mutations. (The effect of radia­ tion in producing such defects is difficult to evaluate.) c) Chromosomal aberrations caused by the presence of too much or too little genetic material in the cells (Down's syndrome, for example). d) Spontaneous abortions. Table 9.7 summarizes the data on the increased incidence of these genetic effects per 106 man-rem of a population with an age distribution similar to that of the United States in 1970. The data include the effect of the transmittal of genetic defects to subsequent generations. Such propagation dies out after about three gen­ erations. The wide uncertainty in the effect on multifactorial disorders should be noted. Catarac ts Vision-impairing opacity of the lenses of the eyes caused by radiation, or radiation cataracts, have a latent period of about 10 months and may appear as long as 35 years after exposure. They are a threshold phenomenon and do not occur with absorbed doses below the 200-to-5 00-rad range for low LET radiation. Where the population is exposed to whole-body doses of this order of magnitude, there would be few survivors with radiation cataracts. The correspond­ ing threshold for fission neutrons is in the vicinity of 75 to 100 rads. Fertility The probable effects on human fertility, both male and female, of acute doses of y-rays to the gonads are given in Table 9.8; comparable data for neutrons are not available.

This leads to perma­ nent, although not necessarily debilitating, impainnent of organ function. The oc­ currence of such degenerative effects is to be expected in view of the damage that large doses can do to tissues and organs, an example of which was given in the preceding section. Life Shortening The overall effect of radiation exposure may be seen in its influence on the life span of exposed individuals. This is clearly to be expected, if only on the basis of the other long-tenn effects just discussed. Much of the ev­ idence of life shortening has come from studies of the obituaries of physicians. It has been found, for example, that the average life span of radiologists who died between 1935 and 1944 was 4.8 years shorter than for other medical specialists who were not exposed to radiation, but who died in the same period. At the present time, it is generally believed that any observed life shortening arising from radia­ tion exposure is due solely to the appearance of radiation-induced malignancies. Chronic Low Doses As already noted, doses of a few millirems per day, which accumula te up to a few rems per year, are of considerable concern in the development of nuclear power. This is the dose level pennitted under current standards of radiation protection, which is discussed in Section 9.8. It is not surprising, therefore, that an enonnous effort has been made over the years to detennine what, if any, deleterious effects accompany chronic exposure to low levels of radiation. To date, the results are in­ conclusive. Thus, according to the Committee on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiations of the US National Academy of Sciences, 12 12BEIR V report, p. 181. (See references.)

 text: 494 Radiation Protection Chap. 9 Derivation of risk estimates for low doses and low dose rates through the use of any type model involves assumptions that remain to be validated Moreover, epidemiologic data cannot rigorously exclude the existence of a threshold in the mil­ lisievert dose range. Thus, the possibility that there may be no risks from exposures comparable to the external natural background cannot be ruled out At such low dose rates, it must be acknowledged that the lower limit of the range of uncertainty in the risk estimates extends to zero. In view of the evident lack of adequate human data on the effects of low levels of radiation, these effects are estimated, or postulated, by various dose-response models. For simplicity and conservatism, the linear hypothesis is often used. There exists a large body of evidence that strongly suggests the linear model overesti­ mates the consequences of chronic exposure to low levels of radiation. In fact, the data suggest that doses in the range of 10-20 cGy (10-20 Rad) may be beneficial in lowering the chances of cancer in children and adults. Doses above 10 cGy are still potentially harmful to fetuses at 8-15 weeks gestation, based on analysis of Hiroshima and Nagasaki bomb survivors. The linear hypothesis entirely ignores the capability of biological systems to repair themselves, even at the molecular level. For instance, it has been found that if only one strand of a DNA molecule (which consists of two strands twisted in the form of a double helix) is broken, the molecule may remain intact and the broken strand reconstituted in its original form. Such repair mechani sms may function normally at low rates of radiation exposure, but may be overwhelmed at high dose rates. The theory of radiation hormesis suggests that organisms respond positively to low doses of radiation. The responses include inhibition of cancer and reduction in the aging pro cess. While this theory is still under investigation, it is completely consistent with the observed data from the victims of the atomic bomb and with many of the other radiation case studies. Notwithstanding the possibility that low doses result in a positive effect, the BEIR Committee and the regulatory agencies at this time are still utilizing the linear hypothesis and will likely continue to do SO.13 There is a growing consensus that the linear hypothesis is too conservative, and this may eventually lead to the acceptance of a threshold dose or even the application of radiation for preventive reasons. 13The BEIR V report acknowledges the possibility of at least a threshold of radiation health effects when it states, "For combined data (Hiroshima and Nagasaki), the rate of mortality is sig­ nificantly elevated at 0.4 Gy (40 Rad) and above, but not at lower dose. At bone marrow doses of 3-4 Gy, the estimated dose-response curve peaks and turns downward." p. 242, op cit.

 text: Sec. 9.6 Calculations of Radiation Effects 495 9.6 CALCU LATIONS OF RADIATION EFFECTS The data on radiation effects developed in the preceding sections will now be ap­ plied to specific cases of radiation exposure. As done earlier, acute and chronic exposures will be considered separately. Acute Exposu res The probable short-tenn consequences of acute exposure to an individual can be detennined directly from the infonnation in Table 9.4. As indicated in the table, there are no serious, clinically observable effects below whole-body doses of 75 rems. Calculating the late effects of an acute exposure-in particular, the proba­ bility of the individual contracting radiation-induced cancer-is somewhat more complica ted, because this probability depends on the location of the malignancy and the age of the individual at the time of the exposure. Nevertheless, the calcula­ tion is relatively straightforward; it is best described by a specific example. Example 9.3 In a radiation accident, a 30-year-old male worker receives an acute whole-body dose of 25 rems. What is the probability that the worker will die from cancer as a result of this exposure? [Note: In the United States, a 30-year-old male, on the average, lives to an age of 77 years.] Solution. The desired probability is the sum of the probabilities of death from cancer at any site in the worker's body. First, consider bone cancer. According to Table 9.6, the latent period is 10 years, so the probability of his getting this cancer from the radiation is zero until he is 40 years old. For 30 years thereafter, his chances of dying as a result of bone cancer are roughly constant at 0.2 per year per 106 rems. Because his dose was 25 rems, the probability of his dying over this period is 25 -4 106 X 30 x 0.2 = 1.5 x 10 or 1.5 chances in 10,000. He reaches the end of the risk plateau at the age of 70, and has, on the average, 7 remaining years with zero probability of contracting bone cancer due to his original exposure. In a similar way, the probabilities of other cancers can easily be computed. The total probability is 4.7 x 10-3 [Ans.] The probability of dying from cancer at the age of 30 years or older is approx­ imately 0.25, so the radiation increased this probability by 4.7 x 10-3/0.25 = 0.019 or about 2%. In this example, the entire risk plateau period lay within the worker's expected life span. Had the plateau extended beyond his life span, only that portion of the plateau within his life span would be used in the calculation. It must also be noted that the foregoing solution is not entirely exact, since the total probability of death was taken simply to be the risk per year multiplied

page number: 514
 text: 496 Radiation Protection Chap. 9 by the length of the plateau. This clearly overstates the risk, for in order for the worker to die of radiation-induced cancer near the end of the plateau, he must not have succumbed to this disease before that time. The exact solution is similar to the calculation of the probability that a particle can move a given distance in a medium with or without a collision, as discussed in Section 3.3. The present simplifica tion is possible, because the probability of survival over the entire plateau is very close to unity. In a radiation accident involving the public at large, people of all ages may be irradiated. Unless a priori knowledge of the age distribution within the irradiated group is available, it is the usual practice to assume that this distribution coincides with the average age distribution in the country as a whole. To determine the long­ term effect of an acute exposure, it is then necessary to compute the probability that a cancer of any type will appear in each cohort in the population. A portion of this computation is given in the next example. Example 9.4 In a hypothetical radiation accident, one million persons each receive a dose of ex­ actly 1 rem. How many cases of leukemia can be expected to result in this popula­ tion? Solution. The solution to this problem is given in Table 9.9. The first three columns give the fractions of the US population in specified cohorts and the corresponding additional life expectancies. Column 4 gives the years at risk (i.e., the number of years for which the risk is nonzero). This is either the full duration of the plateau or the life expectancy less the latent period, whichever is smaller.

The last column shows the number of leukemia cases expected over the lifetime of each cohort. For instance, the number of deaths in the in utero cohort is 0.011 x 10 x 15 = 1.65; the number in the 51-60 cohort is 0.104 x 22.5 x 1 = 2.34; and so on. The total number of leukemia cases (and deaths) is 28.4. [Ans.] When calculations similar to those in Example 9.4 are carried out for other types of cancer, the resulting numbers of eventual deaths are as shown in Table 9.10. These calculations give the consequences of a dose of 1 rem to 106 people. However, since the risk coefficients used in the computations are based on the linear hypothesis, the number of deaths would be the same if 0.5 x 106 people received 2 rems, 0.25 x 106 people received 4 rems, and so on, as long as the total number of man-rems remained the same. This may be seen from the next argument. Let P(R) be the absolute probability that an individual will eventually die of cancer following a dose of H rems. The function P(R) is the dose-response function plotted in Fig. 9.6. If N(H)dH persons in the population N receive doses of between Rand d H rems, the number of eventual cancer deaths is n = 100 N(H) P(H)dH. (9.12) According to the linear hypothesis, P (H) is given by the simple function P(H) = aH, (9.13) where a is a constant. The number of deaths is then n = a 100 N(H)HdH = aHpop. (9.14)

page number: 516
 text: 498 Radiation Protection Chap. 9 where use has been made of Eq. (9.11). It follows from Eq. (9.14) that the total number of cancer deaths, on the basis of the linear hypothesis, is independent of the magnitude of the individual doses and depends only on the population dose, Hpop. This considerably simplifies calculations of the consequences of radiation accidents to the public. Thus, if the population in question has the same age dis­ tribution as the one used in calculating Table 9.10, the number of eventual cancer deaths from a population dose Hpop is simply n = 135Hpop. (9.15) As remarked in the preceding section, the linear hypothesis is widely believed to overestimate the late effects of radiation exposure, especially at low doses. A more accurate representation of the dose-response function is often taken to be of the form (9.16) where the values of f31 and f32 are the subject of continuing debate; but, in any case, f31 is less than a in Eq. (9.13). Unfortunately, functions such as that given in Eq. (9.16) are somewhat more difficult to apply in practice, since the number of cancer deaths in an irradiated population depends on the distribution of doses to different individual s, and not on the population dose alone. Chronic Exposur e Because it is necessary to take into account the manner in which a dose is received over time, the calculation of the late effects of chronic low doses is especially tedious if base� on the linear-quadratic form of P(H) given in Eq. (9.16). With such a function, it makes a difference whether an annual dose of 5 rems is received in one day or spread out over the year at a rate of 14 mrems per day. With the linear model, the fractionation of the dose is irrelevant, and only the total dose over a given interval need be considered. Example 9.S A radiation worker takes his first job at the age of 18. He continues to be so employed for 50 years and retires at the age of 68. If he receives an average annual occupational dose of 5 rems (which is the maximum acceptable dose according to current regu­ lations; see Section 9.8) throughout his working career, what is the probability that he will incur and die of bone cancer as the result of this exposure? Use the linear hypothesis. Solution. An accurate solution to this problem requires life-expectancy data on an annual basis from age 18 to 68. Such data are available but too lengthy to be repro­ duced here. An estimate of the probability can be made from Table 9.9 by assuming, where necessa ry, that all the radiation to a given cohort is received at the beginning of the cohort interval. This tends to overestimate the years at risk toward the end of

 text: Sec. 9.7 Natural and Man-Made Radiation Sources 499 the worker's career. The computation is similar to that of Example 9.3, except that, in this problem, the worker is assumed to receive a sequence of annual acute doses of 5 rems. The total probability of his dying from bone cancer is then readily calculated to be 1.2 x 10-3, or 1.2 chances in 1,000. 9.7 NATURAL AND MAN-MADE RADIATION SOURCES Throughout history, mankind has been exposed to radiation from the environment. This has come from two sources: cosmic rays, highly energetic radiation bombard­ ing the earth from outer space; and terrestrial radiation, originating in radionu­ clides found in the earth and in our own bodies. In recent years, these natural radiation sources have been augmented by medical x-rays, nuclear weapons, nu­ clear reactors, television, and numerous other radiation-producing devices. It is important to know the magnitude of the doses that the public receives from these sources in order to place in perspective the standards of radiation exposure es­ tablished by various regulatory bodies. Average annual doses to residents of the United States from the most significa nt sources are given in Table 9.11. Cosmic Rays The primary cosmic radiation incident on the earth consists of a mixture of protons ("'87%), a-particles ('" 11 %), and a trace of heavier nuclei ('" 1 %) and electrons ('" 1 %). The energies of these particles range between 108 and 1020 e V, with the bulk lying between 108 and 1011 e V. There is no known mechanism for the produc­ tion of such highly energetic radiation-in short, the origin of cosmic rays is not understood. The primary cosmic rays are almost entirely attenuated as they interact in the first few hundred g/cm2 of the atmosphere. Large numbers of secondary particles, in particular, neutrons, additional protons, and charged pions (short-lived subnu­ clear particles), are produced as a result of these interactions. The subsequent decay of the pions results in the production of electrons, muons (other subnuclear parti­ cles), and a few photons. The resulting particle fluxes, which depend somewhat on the geomagnetic latitude, are given in Table 9.12 for sea level in the northern part of the United States. The annual cosmic ray dose at sea level is between 26 and 27 mrems. The dose rate increases with altitude. Persons living in Denver, Colorado (the "mile­ high city"), receive approximately twice the annual dose from cosmic rays as people living at sea level. When the fractions of the population living at different altitudes and latitudes are taken into account, the average annual dose due to cos­ mic rays in the United States is about 31 mrems. Since some of this radiation is shielded by buildings, this dose is reduced to the 28 mrems shown in Table 9.11.

Terrestrial Radiation There are approximately 340 naturally occurring nuclides found on earth. Of these, about 70 are radioactive. Radioactivity is, therefore, everywhere; there is no escape from radiation exposure due to natural radioactivity in the environment or in the human body. It is usual to divide the natural radionuclides into two groups, depending upon their origin: primordial radionuclides, those that have been here since the earth was fonned, and cosmogenic radionuclides, those that are continually being produced by the action of cosmic rays. It goes without saying that primordial nuclides must be very long-lived. A nuclide with a half-life even as long as 10 million years would have passed through 450 half-lives over the approximately 4.5 x 109 years since the earth was fonned, and its original activity would have diminished by a factor of 10135 The nuclide, in short, would have vanished entirely from the earth. The most common primordial nuclides are 238U(Tl/2 = 4.5 X 109 yrs), 235U(Tl/2 = 7.1 X 108 yrs), 232Th(Tl/2 = 1.4 X 1010 yrs), 87Rb(Tl/2 = 4.8 X 1010 yrs), and 4oK(Tl/2 = 1.3 X 109 yrs). The first three of these nuclides are the parents of long decay chains, such as the one shown in Fig. 9.7 for 238U. As discussed later, some of the daughters in such chains may be of considerable biological significance. A dozen or so other primordial radioisotopes are known, but none of these has an important impact on the human radiation environment. The presence on earth of naturally occurring short-lived radionuclides, such as 14C(Tl/2 = 5,730 yrs), is due to their production by cosmic rays. Obviously, all of the 14C would have disappeared billions of years ago if it were not continually replenished. About 25 other cosmogenic radionuclides have been identified, but only 14C leads to significa nt radiation doses. This nuclide is fonned primarily in the interaction of thennalized cosmic-r ay neutrons with nitrogen in the atmosphere via the exothennic reaction 14N (n, p) 14C. External exposure to terrestrial radioactivity originates with the y-rays emit­ ted following the decay of uranium, thorium, and their daughter products. These radionuclides are widely, but unevenly, distributed about the world. In the United States, for instance, there are three broad areas of differing terrestrial y-ray levels, as shown in Fig. 9.8. The Colorado Plateau lies atop geological fonnations rich in uranium and radium.; as a result, this region tends to have a much higher radiation

Chap. 9 level than other parts of the country. There are also locations in the world, partic­ ularly in Brazil and India, where the presence of thorium-bearing monozite sands leads to radiation levels that are especially high (up to 3mRJhr) . The population­ averaged annual external terrestrial dose in the United States is 26 mrems. The principal source of internal terrestrial exposure is from primordial 40K. This peculiar nuclide decays both by negative ,8-decay to 40Ca and by positive ,8- decay or electron capture to 40 Ar. Its isotopic abundance is 0.0118 a/a, so there is about 0.0157 g of 40K from a total of 130 g of potassium in an average person weighing 70 kg. The total activity of the 40K in the body is therefore approximately O.ll/LCi. The heavy primordial nuclides and their daughters enter the body by inges­ tion of drinking water or foodstuffs in which they are distributed in various trace amounts. Heavy radionuclides also enter the body as the result of inhalation of 222Rn(Tl/2 = 3.8 days) and its daughter products, especially 21OPb(Tl/2 = 21 yrs).

 text: Sec. 9.7 Natural and Man-Made Radiation Sources Figure 9.8 Terrestrial y-ray doses in the United States. (From "The Ef­ fects on Populations of Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation." National Academy of Sciences, 1980.) 503 222Rn is the immediate daughter of the decay of 226Ra, and it is therefore produced in radium-bearing rocks, soil, and construction materials. Since 222Rn is a noble gas, it tends to diffuse into the atmosphere, where it may travel large distances before it decays via several short-lived species to 21OPb. The half-life of 222Rn is long compared with the residence time of air in the lungs, so that relatively little radon decays during respir ation. What is more important, the chemical inertness of radon prevents its long-tenn retention within the body. As a result, 222Rn itself con­ tributes very little to the internal body dose. However, 210Pb is not inert, and soon after its fonnation from 222Rn, it becomes attached to moisture or dust particles in the atmosphere. When these particles are inhaled, some of the 210Pb is retained by the body. 210Pb may also enter the body through ingestion or by the decay of ingested parents.14 In any event, if this were not already complica ted enough, the 210Pb does not itself lead to significant internal doses, since it is only a weak fJ-ray emitter. Rather, it is 21OpO(TI/2 = 138 days), the decay product of 21OPb, that emits a powerful 5.3-MeV a-particle that provides the ultimate dose. Thus, the 222Rn and 210Pb can be viewed as different sorts of carriers for 21OpO, the actual source of radiation damage. 14 2IOPb and 2IOpO can also enter the body via cigarette smoke; see the next section.

 text: 504 Radiation Protection Chap. 9 The heavy radionuclides provide local doses out of proportion to their con­ centrations. This is because many of these nuclides (such as 21OPO) decay by emit­ ting a-particles, which are more energetic than the fJ-rays or y-rays emitted by other radioactive species. Furthermore, as discussed in Section 9.2, a-particles are more harmful biologically, as reflected in their higher quality factors. According to Table 9.11, the heavy elements give an annual dose of 8 mrems to the gonads and 8.5 mrems to the bone marrow. Both 226Ra and 228Ra, however, are chemically similar to calcium and, like calcium, tend to concentrate in the bone (as opposed to the marrow). The dose to the structural bone tissue (the osteocytes and the tissues in the Haversion canals) is therefore considerably higher than the dose to the mar­ row. Fortunately, these tissues are not radiosensitive. The bulk of the heavy element dose to the gonads and marrow is due to 21OpO, although some studies suggest that radon and its projeny are the second leading cause of lung cancer behind smoking. The only cosmogenic nuclide to make a significa nt contribution to internal human exposure is 14C. The concentration of I4C in natural carbon has been found to be the same in all living species, namely 7.5 picocuries (l pCi = 10-12Ci) per gram of carbon. 15 Since about 18% by weight of the human body is carbon, the total body burden of an average 70-kg man is approximately 0.1 !LCi. This gives an estimated dose of 0.7 mrem/year. Man-Made Sources Medical Exposu res By far, the largest nontrivial-localized dose received by the public at large from man-made sources is in connection with the healing arts. This dose includes contributions from medical and dental diagnostic radi­ ology, clinical nuclear medicine (the use of radionuclides for various purposes), radiation therapy, and occupational exposure of medical and dental personnel. The dose rates, given in Table 9.11, are based on studies by the Bureau of Radiological Health of the US Department of Health, Education and Welfare. (See references at end of chapter.) Fallout Fallout from a nuclear weapon consists of fission fragments and neutron activation products in weapon debris that become attached to dust and wa­ ter particles in the atmosphere. The larger of these particles soon come to earth near the site of the detonation, but the smaller ones may remain aloft in the upper atmosphere for five years or more. In time, they become distributed more or less uniformly around the world, and contribute to the general level of environmen­ tal radiation. The long-term exposure from fallout is mostly internal, from fission 15When a plant or animal dies, this equilibrium concentration is no longer maintained, due to the decay of the 14c. By measuring the 14C/C ratio, it is therefore possible to determine the age of nonliving organic materials, a technique known as carbon dating.

In the absence of further atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons, 16 the annual whole-body dose from fallout will be between 4 and 5 mrems through the year 2000. Nuclear Power The environmental effects of nuclear power will be dis­ cussed in full in Chapter 11. It may be said at this point, however, that the con­ clusion seems inescapable that the increasing use of nuclear power will lead to a small, but increasing, radiation dose to the general pUblic. This dose is due not only to radiation released from power plants themselves, but also from uranium mines, mills and fabrication piants, and fuel-repr ocessing facilities. In any case, the population-a veraged dose in the United States was less than 1 mrem/year in 1980. The occupational dose to workers in the commercial nuclear industry is com­ puted from industry data submitted to and published by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. (See Table 9.11.) Building Materials Many building materials, especially granite, cement, and concrete, contain a few parts per million of uranium and thorium, together with their radioactive daughters, and 4oK. Exposure to the radiation emanating directly from the walls of brick or masonry structures gives their occupants an annual dose of approximately 7 mrems. Building materials are also a source of 222Rn, and occupants of brick and masonry buildings, especially those with poor ventilation, may receive substan­ tiallung doses from the subsequent decay of the 2lOpo. Radon also enters buildings from other natural sources through basement openings; through windows and other openings; from the burning of natural gas, which frequently contains large amounts of radon; and from the spraying of radon-rich water from shower heads. Exceed­ ingly high levels of radon, far in excess of established standards (discussed in the next section), have been measured in well-insula ted houses that necessarily lack adequate ventilation. The average radon-related dose to an individual is estimated to be 200 mrem/yr. Air Travel The radiation dose from air travel stems from the fact that mod­ em jet aircraft fly at high altitudes, from 9 to 15 km, where the cosmic ray dose rate is much greater than it is on the ground. For instance, at 43° north latitude (just north of Chicago) and at an altitude of 12 km, the dose rate is 0.5 mrem/hr. A 10-hour round trip flight across the United States can result, therefore, in a total dose of as much as 5 mrems. It is of interest to note in Table 9.11 that the aver­ age dose to aircraft flight crews is a significa nt fraction of the dose to occupational workers in the nuclear industry. 16 Atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons was terminated by Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in 1962, by France in 1974, and later by all nuclear weapons states.

 text: 506 Radiation Protection Chap. 9 Television Radiation is released in the fonn of x-rays from at least three sources within color television receivers . With increasing numbers of television viewers exposed to this radiation, the US Congress in 1968 passed standards re­ quiring that the exposure rate averaged over 10 cm2 at any readily accessible point 5 cm from the surface of a television receiver not exceed 5 mRlhr. With the adop­ tion of this regulation, the individual dose rate has fallen over the past decade, and the average annual dose to the gonads of viewers is now between 0.2 and 1.5 mrems. Tobacco As noted earlier, 222Rn diffuses from the earth to the atmosphere, where it decays into 21OPb, which subsequently falls to the earth attached to dust or moisture particles. If these particles fall onto leafy vegetables or pasture grasses, the 210Pb may enter directly into the food chain. Of perhaps greater significa nce is the fact that if the particles fall onto broadleaf tobacco plants, the 210Pb and its daughter 21Opo may be incorporated into commercial smoking materials. Measure­ ments show that there are on the order of 10 to 20 pCi of both 210Pb and 21OpO in an average pack of cigarettes. The inhalation of cigarette smoke deposits these radionuclides on the tracheobronchial tree, where the 210pO irradiates the radiosen­ sitive basal cel ls of the bronchial tissue. The annual local dose to this tissue for an average cigarette smoker (1.5 packs per day) is estimated to be as high as 8 rems (8,000 mrems) and proportionately higher for heavy smokers. Many researchers believe that this radiation is the origin of the high incidence of lung cancer among smokers. Other Man-M ade Sources Segments of the public are exposed to sev­ eral other, often unsuspected, sources of radiation. Clocks and wristwatches with luminous dials, eyeglasses or porcelain dentures containing uranium or thorium, smoke detectors with a-emitting sources, fossil-fueled power plants that emit ra­ dioactive ash, and many other man-made devices result in generally small whole­ body doses, but occasionally high local doses. For example, porcelain teeth and crowns in the United States contain approximately 0.02% uranium by weight. This is estimated to give an annual local tissue dose of about 30 rems, mostly from a-particles. 9.8 STANDARDS OF RADIATION PROTECTION In 1928, in response to the growing recognition of the hazards of radiation, the Sec­ ond International Congress of Radiology established the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) to set standards of peflllissible exposure to ra­ diation. Shortly thereafter, in 1929, the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) was set up in the United States at the national level to

 text: Sec. 9.8 Standards of Radiation Protection 507 perform the functions undertaken internationally by the ICRP.17 In 1964, NCRP was given a federal charter by the US Congress to assure that the organization would remain an independent scientific agency and not be subject to governmental control. Until 1970, official US Government policy regarding permissible radiation exposure was determined by the Federal Radiation Council (FRC), which was established to "advise the President with regard to radiation matters directly or indirectly affecting health The FRC was composed of the Secretaries of Agriculture; Commerce; Def ense; Health, Education and Welfare; Labor; and the Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission; together with a technical staff. In 1970, the functions and staff of the FRC were transferred to the newly formed Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Standards for exposure to radiation rec­ ommended by the EPA, and earlier by the FRC, are called radiation protection guides (RPGs). When these guides have been approved by the President, they have the force and effect of law, as all agencies of the Government are required to follow the guides. The regulations of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which are applicable to its licensees, must be consistent with the RPGs. In most countries other than the United States, official radiation policy is based directly on ICRP recommendati ons. Not surprisingly, the recommended standards of the ICRP, the NRCP, and the EPA are not identical. Furthermore, these standards are continually revised, as the membership on these bodies changes and as new information on the biological effects of radiation becomes available. Nevertheless, the standards-setting bodies are now in agreement on the following ground rules for radiation exposure: a) Since any exposure to radiation may be potentially harmful, no deliberate exposure is justified unless some compens atory benefit will be realized. b) All exposure to radiation should be kept "as low as reasonably achievable" (ALARA), taking into account the state of technology, the economics of re­ ducing exposures relative to the benefits to be achieved, and other relevant socioeconomic factors. (The ALAR A concept is also used in connection with the emission of effluents from nuclear power plants; see Section 11.9.) c) Radiation doses to individuals should not exceed certain recommended val­ ues. For many years, these limiting doses were known as maximum permissi­ ble doses (MPDs), and this term persists in general usage. More recently, the ICRP has preferred the term dose limit to MPD. Both the FRC and EPA have always used the RPG standards instead of the MPD. 17More precisely, from 1929 to 1946, the NCRP was known as the Advisory Committee on X-ray and Radium Protection; from 1946 to 1956, the National Committee on Radiation Protection; from 1956 to 1964, the National Committee on Radiation Protection and Measurements; and from 1964 until the present time, the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements.

 text: 508 Radiation Protection Chap. 9 Although there is no evidence of harm from low levels of exposure, scientists are reluctant to assume that there is no effect at all. To fill this gap, the standards­ setting bodies arbitrarily have made the following assumptions: a) There is a linear dose-effect relationship for all radiation effects from high dose levels in the ranges of several hundreds of rads down to zero dose. b) There is no threshold radiation dose above which an effect may occur, but below which it does not. c) Low doses delivered to an organ are additive, no matter at what rate or at what intervals they may be delivered. d) There is no biological recovery from radiation effects at low doses. As a practical matter, MPDs or RPGs have traditionally been established from the consensus judgments of members of the standard s-setting bodies. Be­ cause such judgments are necessarily qualitative, the precise effect of adopting a particular standard can never be ascertained. The ICRP, using dose-effect com­ putations such as those discussed in the preceding section, compared the number of fatalities among radiation workers from continued exposure to ICRP dose lim­ its with the comparable number of fatalities in other occupations. It was found that the average risk of death, which in the case of radiation workers is due al­ most entirely to the eventual contraction of cancer, is actually smaller than the risk of job-rela ted death in the safest of other major occupational categories, namely, the retail trades. Furthermore, there are essentially no injuries to radiation workers due to radiation exposure-the allowed dose limits are far below the threshold for observable nonstochastic effects. Thus, for the first time, a quantitative basis for radiation standards has been established. The standards are regularly reviewed, both in the United States and elsewhere. The current standard in the United States is based largely on ICRP Publications 26 and 30. The criteria were adopted by the EPA and then, as required by law, by the US NRC in 1994. More recent recommendations were promulgated by the ICRP in 1990 in Publication 60. The later requirements have yet to be adopted in the United States. For complete ness, both the recommendati ons of Publications 26 and 60 are included in this section. An abridged summary of recommended dose limits for external and internal exposures is presented in Table 9.13. As noted in the table, dose limits are given for two categories: occupational exposure to radiation workers and exposure to the public at large. With regard to nonuniform external exposure (i.e., exposure of one portion of the body more than another), the ICRP has adopted the principle that the risk of developing a fatal malignancy from a regional exposure should be the same as the risk when the whole body is irradiated uniformly. Because the ICRP whole-body

Recommended values of WT are given in Table 9.14; the value shown for "other organs" may be used for as many as five organs not listed (those receiving the highest dose should be used). Equation (9.17) can be interpreted in the following way: using the ICRP 26 value of WT for the lung, an annual dose of 5/0.12 = 42 rems to this organ alone should carry the same risk as an annual dose of 5 rem to the whole body. Similarly, a dose of 5/0.03 = 167 rems to the thyroid alone should be equivalent to 5 rems whole body (but see the next paragraph!). And so on.i8 18The USNRC adopted the tissue-weighting factors of ICRP 26 in 1991 which became effec­ tive in 1994.

Chap. 9 The standards given in Table 9.13 are predicated on limiting stochastic events (i.e., cancer). Nonstochastic effects, according to the ICRP, should be prevented by limiting the annual dose to 50 rems to anyone organ, except the lens of the eye, which is permitted to receive only 30 rems. Thus, based on ICRP standards, the 42 rems to the lung computed would be acceptable; the 167 rems to the thyroid would not be acceptable, since it exceeds 50 rems. Limits have also been established by the standards-setting bodies for the max­ imum allowable intake of radionuclides into the body, based on the doses that these materials give to various body organs. These limits, and the methods by which they are calculated, are discussed in Section 9.9. Incidentally, it may be noted that an annual MPD of 5 rems is approximately equivalent to 100 mrems/week, and the MPD is often given in these terms. Also, 100 mrems distributed over a 40-hour week is equal to a dose-equivalent rate of 2.5 mremslhr. Under US Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations, any space accessible to personnel where a person can receive a dose in excess 5 mremslhr is defined as a radiation area and is required to be posted with warning signs. The MPD for individuals in the general population is much higher than the average dose allowed for the population as a whole. The MPD for individuals has been universally set (except by the EPA, which has not proposed guides for nonoc­ cupational exposure) at 0.5 rem/year; the maximum average population dose is usually taken to be 5 rems/30 years, or about 170 mrems/year. The individual dose is based on reducing the risk of cancer, whereas the population dose rests on the risk of genetic damage, which was once thought to be of greater significance. Ac­ cording to the ICRP, recent data indicate that the opposite is true, and the ICRP no longer considers it necessary to set the average dose limit for the population lower than the limit for individuals.

 text: Sec. 9.9 Computations of Exposure and Dose 511 It must be emphasized that the dose limits in Table 9.13 refer to radiation doses over and above those received from normal background radiation and from the so-called healing arts. Finally, the reader is cautioned to be alert for changes in the radiation standards that will certainly be made from time to time in the future. The ICRP has recommended considerable reduction in the dose limits and weighting factors. (See Table (9.13) and (9.14).) The reductions are based on a conservative analysis of the atomic bomb victims. The standard s-setting bodies never sleep. 9.9 COMPUTATIONS OF EXPOSURE AND DOSE It is often necessary to compute the exposure, absorbed dose, and dose equivalent, or their rates, resulting from various configurations of radiation sources. Such com­ putations are somewhat different for y-rays, neutrons, and charged particles, and they depend upon whether the exposure is external or internal. External Exposure to ,-Rays From Section 9.2, it will be recalled that exposure to y-rays is measured in roent­ gens (R), where 1 R corresponds to the liberation of 2.58 x 10-4 coul of charge of either sign, when the y-rays interact with 1 kg of air. For computing exposure, it is convenient to relate the roentgen to the energy that must be deposited in the air in order to liberate this charge. Repeated calculations involving electrical charge can then be avoided. To produce 2.58 x 10-4 coul requires the formation of 2.58 x 10-4/1.60 X 10-19 = 1.61 X 1015 ion pairs (an ion and an ejected electron), where 1.60 x 10-19 is the charge in coulombs of either the ion or the electron. It has been found ex­ perimentally that approximately 34 e V (between 32 and 36 e V) must be deposited by y-rays in air to produce an ion pair. The liberation of 2.58 x 10-4 coul thus requires the absorption of 1.61 x 1015 x 34 = 5.47 x 1016 eV. An exposure of 1 R corresponds, therefore, to an energy deposition of 1 R = 5.47 X 1016 eV/kg = 5.47 x 1010 MeV/kg = 5.47 x 107 MeV/g. (9.18) Since 1 MeV = 1.60 x 10-6 ergs, it follows that 1 R = 5.47 X 107 x 1.60 X 10-6 = 87.5 ergs/g. (9.19) To compute the y-ray exposure from a specified radiation field, it is neces­ sary only to determine the energy absorbed from the y-rays in the air, and then to convert to roentgens using one of the above energy equivalents. Similarly, the

page number: 530
 text: 512 Radiation Protection Chap. 9 exposure rate can be found from the rate at which y-ray energy is deposited. It was shown in Section 3.8 that the energy deposition rate per unit mass is given by [E(ll-al p)air, where [ is the y-ray intensity, E is the y-ray energy, and (Il-al p)air is the mass absorption coefficient of air at the energy E. Values of (/.La 1 p )air are given in Table 11.5. By making use of Eq. (9.19), it follows that the exposure rate X is given by X = I E (/.La 1 P )air 15.47 x 107 = 1.83 X 10-8 [E(f1al p)air Rlsec. (9.20) In this equation, [ must be expressed in photons/cm 2-sec, E is in MeV, and (f1al p ) air is in cm2/g. For many practical problems, it is more appropriate to express X in mRlhr, rather than in Rlsec. Then, since 1 Rlsec = 3.6 x 106 mRIhr, Eq. (9.20) can be written as X = 0.0659[ E(/.Lal p)air mRlhr. (9.21) It is evident from Eqs. (9.20) and (9.21) that the exposure rate depends both on the intensity of the y-rays and on their energy. Figure 9.9 shows the intensity (or flux; cf. later in this section) necessary to give an exposure rate of 1 mRlhr. The curve, in part, reflects the energy dependence of (f1al p )air, which is large at low energies, owing to photoelectric absorption, has a minimum at about 0.07 Me V, and then rises because of pair production. Less y-ray intensity is obviously needed to provide a given exposure rate where the absorption coefficient is large. Equation (9.21) applies only to a monoenergetic beam. If the y-rays have a distribution of energies, it is necessary to integrate Eq. (9.21) over the spectrum if this is continuous, or to sum over the spectrum if it is a discrete (line) spectrum. For instance, in the latter case, the exposure rate is (9.22) where Ii is the intensity of y-rays of energy Ei and (f1al p )�ir is the mass absorption coefficient at Ei• To obtain the total exposure over a time T, the preceding fonnulas must be in­ tegrated with respect to time. If time is measured in seconds, then from Eq. (9.20), x = loT k dt = 1.83 x 10-8 E(Jla/ p),"' loT /(t) dt = 1.83 x 10-8<1>E(f1al p)airR. (9.23)

 text: 514 Radiation Protection Solution. Solving Eq. (9.21) for I gives I = X /0.0659E(/.La/ p)air Chap. 9 From Table 11.5, (/.La/ p)air = 0.0238 cm2/g at 2 MeV. Introducing this value gives I = 1/0.0659 x 2 x 0.0238 = 319y-rays/cm2-sec, [Ans.] which is also the value shown in Fig. 9.9. Dose from ,-Rays: External Exposure Calculations of y-ray absorbed dose, dose-equivalent, and the corresponding dose rates are similar to the preceding calculations of exposure. According to Section 9.2, absorbed dose is measured in rads, where 1 rad is equal to the absorption of 100 ergs of y -ray energy per gram of tissue. In more convenient units, this is equivalent to 100/1.60 x 10-6 = 6.25 X 107 MeV/g. Then, since the y-ray absorption rate is 1 E(/.La/ p)tis MeV/g-sec, where (/.La/ p)tis is the mass absorption coefficient of tissue, it follows that the absorbed dose rate D is given by D = 1E(/.La/p)tis/6.25 x 107 = 1.60 x 10-8IE(/.La/p)tis rad/sec (9.25) = 0.05761 E(/.La/ p)tis mradlhr. (9.26) To obtain the total absorbed dose, D, in either rad or mrad, the intensity I in Eqs. (9.25) or (9.26) is replaced by the fluence <P. The absorbed dose rate in a tissue that is subject to an exposure rate X can be found by dividing Eq. (9.25) by Eq. (9.20); that is, . 1.60 X 10-81 E(/.La/ p)tis . D= .x 1. 83 x 10-8 E 1 (/.La / p )'!J.r = 0.874 (/.La/ P )ti.S X. (/.La / p )alr (9.27) Since this relationship between D and X depends on the absorption coefficient of the tissue, the same value X can give quite different Ds in different tissues. It is convenient therefore to write Eq. (9.27) as (9.28) where f is an energy-dependent function that depends on the composition of the tissue. Figure 9.10 shows this function for bone, muscle, and fat tissue. At low en­ ergy, the curve is generally higher for bone than for muscle or fat, because bone contains higher Z constituents that show stronger photoelectric absorption. Since mass absorption coefficients are independent of time, the time integrals of both

Turner, Principles of Radiation Protection. New York: Wiley, 1967.) sides of Eqs. (9.27) and (9.28) are also equal. These equations are therefore valid for total dose and total exposure when b and X are replaced by D and X, respec­ tively. To obtain the dose-equivalent or its rate, it is merely necessary to multiply D or b by the approximate quality factor. However, according to Table 9.2, Q = 1 for y-rays, so that in the present case, Din rads is numerically equal to H in rems, and the foregoing expressions for D and b can be used directly for calculating H or iI. The formulas for X, D, and H and their rates have been derived in this section in terms of the intensity I of a monodirectional beam of y-rays. In many situations of interest, however, the y -rays are not monodirect ional; they move in several or all directions like the neutrons in a reactor. It is then more appropriate to express X, D, and H in terms of the y-ray flux ¢Y' This is defined in the same way as the neutron flux ¢ (see Section 5.1) and has the same units as intensity, namely, y-rays/cm2-sec. Equations (9.21) and (9.26), for example, can then be written as and X = 0.0659¢y E(f.Lal p)air mRlhr b = 0.0576¢y E(f.Lal p)tis mrad/hr. (9.29) (9.30) Example 9.7 The flux near a 50-kV x-ray machine is 2.4 x 105 x-rays/cm2-sec. What is the dose­ equivalent rate in bone, muscle, and fat to an operator standing nearby?

page number: 534
 text: 516 Radiation Protection Chap. 9 Solution. From Fig. 9.9, a flux of approximately 8 x 103 x-rays/cm2-sec gives an exposure rate of 1 mRlhr at 50 ke V. The exposure rate to the operator is therefore 2.4 x 105 8 x 103 X 1 = 30 mRlhr. According to Fig. 9.10, f = 3.3 for bone, 0.93 for muscle, and about 0.90 for fat. The operator would thus receive absorbed dose rates and, since Q = 1, dose-equivalent rates of 3.3 x 30 = 99 mremlhr to bone, 0.93 x 30 = 28 mremlhr to muscle, and 0.90 x 30 = 27 mremlhr to fat. [Ans.] Dose from Neutron s-External Exposu re Dose computations for neutrons are somewhat more difficult than for y -rays, be­ cause of the complex way in which neutrons interact with matter. It will be recalled from Chapter 3 that neutrons may undergo elastic or inelastic scattering, radiative capture, and various reactions. In these interactions, the struck nucleus may recoil with sufficient energy to be stripped of a portion of its electron cloud, whereupon it becomes a highly ionizing, charged particle. With inelastic sca ttering and radiative capture, y-rays are also emitted, and in reactions, charged particles may be pro­ duced. The deposition of energy from these neutron-produced, secondary ionizing radiations must be detennined in order to calculate neutron dose. Because of the complexity of neutron interactions, the energy deposition must be computed numerically, and this is most conveniently done using the Monte Carlo method. In this method, the actual histories of the neutrons and the sec­ ondary radiation to which they give rise are duplicated on a high-speed computer as these radiations move about in a tissue medium. Calculations of this type have been carried out for beams of neutrons incident upon a slab or cylinder having a com­ position similar to that of the human body. 19 In detennining the dose-equivalent, it is necessary to take into account the fact that the quality factor is a function of the energy of an ionizing particle. Thus, when a fast neutron undergoes repeated colli­ sions and produces recoiling nuclei of various energies, the energy deposition from these nuclei must be multiplied by the appropriate quality factor as the calculation proceeds. It is somewhat easier to discuss the results of such computations for a slab of tissue than for a cylinder, because of the simpler geometry. Figures 9.11(a) and (b) show the dose-equivalent as a function of penetration for thennal and for 5-MeV neutrons, respectively. Also shown in these figures are the contributions to the dose due to recoiling protons, recoiling heavier nuclei, and capture y-rays. For the 5-MeV beam, most of the dose is from recoil protons produced by neutron colli­ sions with hydrogen; very little of the dose is due to capture y-rays.

 text: 518 Radiation Protection Chap. 9 hand, with the thennal neutron beam, the proton dose only exceeds the y-ray dose over the first 3 cm. Beyond that point, the dose is primarily due to y-rays. In­ cidentally, at thennal energy, the protons arise from the exothennic (Q = 0.63 MeV) reaction 14N(n, p)14C, which has a cross-section of 1.81 b at 0.0253 eV. At this energy, the neutrons are not sufficiently energetic to produce recoil protons in collisions with hydrogen. When the maximum dose rates from curves like those in Fig. 9.11 are plotted versus energy, the result is the curve shown in Fig. 9.12, which gives the neutron flux as a function of neutron energy required to give a dose of 1 mremlhr. It should be noted in the figure that at the higher energies, a smaller flux is required to pro­ duce a given dose than at the lower energies. In other words, neutron for neutron, the faster neutrons give the larger dose. It is of some interest to note that, except at very low energy, the y-ray flux required to produce a given dose-equivalent is always much larger than the corre­ sponding neutron flux. For instance, from Figs. 9.9 and 9.12, it may be seen that at 1 MeV, a y-ray flux of approximately 550 y-rays/cm2-sec gives an if in tissue of 1 mremlhr, while a neutron flux of only 7.5 neutrons/cm 2-sec will give the same if. Thus, particle for particle, neutrons give larger doses than photons of the same energy. Figure 9.12 can be used to compute either the dose-equivalent rate from a given neutron flux or the total dose-equivalent from a given neutron fluence. This is illustrated by the next two exam ples. Example 9.8 At a point near a neutron source, the fast (greater than 1 MeV) neutron flux is 20 neutrons/cm 2-sec, and the thermal flux is 300 neutrons/cm 2-sec. There are no y-rays. How long may a radiation worker remain at this point if he is not to exceed his normal MPD dose? Solution. According to Fig. 9.12, a fast neutron flux of about 7 neutrons/cm 2-sec gives 1 mremlhr. The worker's fast neutron dose rate is then 20 7 x 1 = 2.8 mremlhr. Similarly, from Fig 9.12, a thermal flux of 260 n�utrons/cm 2 -sec gives I mremlhr, so that the thermal neutron dose is 300 260 x 1.1 mremlhr.

[Ans.] Example 9.9 Compute the dose to a man exposed to a burst of 2.5-MeV neutrons from an accel­ erator source if there is a total of 108 neutrons/cm 2 in the burst. Solution. From Fig. 9.12, a flux of 7 fast neutrons/cm 2-sec will give a dose of 1 mrem in one hour, so a fluence of 7 x 3,600 = 2.52 x 104 neutrons/cm 2 gives a dose of 1 mrem. The fluence in the present case is 108, so the man receives a dose of 108/2.52 x 104 = 3,970 mrems, or about 4 rems. [Ans.] Internal Exposure: Charged Particle s and ,-Rays Because of the short ranges in tissue of charged particles having the energies nor­ mally encountered in nuclear engineering, external exposure to these radiations does not ordinarily represent a significant health hazard, except in major nuclear accidents as discussed in Chapter 11. However, if (X-and f3-rays and their associated y-rays emitted by radioactive nuclides are inhaled, ingested (taken in through the stomach and digested), or are absorbed into the body in some other way, the results can be very serious. The charged-parti cle dose to an organ containing a radioactive nuclide can be computed with accuracy sufficient for most purposes by the following simple method: Suppose that the nuclide is present in the organ in the amount of C(t) microcuries at time t and that it emits a single charged particle with the average energy £, Me V per disintegration.2o Since the range of the radiation is so short, all of the energy £, is absorbed within the organ, except for the radiation origi­ nating from a region near the surface of the organ. Throughout most of the organ, therefore, the energy emitted per second must be equal to the energy absorbed per second. Since 1 /LCi = 3.7 x 104 disintegrations per second, it follows that energy absorbed/sec = 3.7 x I04C(t)E MeV/sec = 5.92 x IO-2C(t)E erg/sec dividing by the mass of the organ in grams 5.92 x IO-2C(t)£, = erg/g-sec, M 20ln the case of a nuclide that decays by the emission of a single negative fJ-ray, E is ap­ proximately equal to 0.3 Emax, where Emax is the maximum {3-ray energy. For positive {3-decay, E ::: OAEmax.

Since these electrons are charged particles, essentially all their energy is absorbed within the organ. The y-rays, how­ ever, do not have a finite range in tissue, and much of their energy is deposited in regions external to the organ. U sing Monte Carlo methods, computations of the fraction of the y -ray en­ ergy retained within an organ as a function of energy and the fraction of energy de­ posited in other organs have been carried out for a variety of organs. 21 The Medical Internal Radiation Dose Committee (MIRD) of the Society for Nuclear Medicine has developed a methodology that accounts for both of these energy depositio ns. The method is general enough that it may be used for both y -rays and for a and f3 radiation. These computations can be summarized in the following way: first, let ¢i be the fraction of the ith radiation's energy absorbed in the target organ. For y-rays, this will be less than one. For a-and f3-rays, it will equal zero or unity, depending on whether the source and target organ are one in the same. If the energy emitted, including charged particles, by a radionuclide is Ei (Ei in the case of f3-rays), then the energy absorbed is where ni is the number of particles emitted with energy Ei• The dose rate for each type of radiation is calculated using the appropriate quality or weighting factor and the emission rate of the particles. For the case where the target organ is the organ in which the radionuclide resides, the dose rate may be calculated as follows. Define 21 The computations in question are described in ICRP 30 and in several supplements to the Journal of Nuclear Medicine, which also has the energy absorbed in one organ from radiation emitted in another.

It follows that radioactive isotopes of iodine go to the thyroid, and the calcium-like radioisotopes of radium and plutonium tend to accumula te in bone. The fraction of a given substance that goes to a particular organ is denoted by the parameter q. The numerical value of q normally depends on whether the substance is inhaled or ingested. In the case of plutonium, for example, q is 0.2 for inhalation and 2.4 x 10-5 for ingestion. Thus, the inhalation of plutonium is a serious matter, although it is virtually harmless if swallowed. Other values of q are given in Table 9.15. No substance, radioactive or not, remains in a body organ indefinitely. Normal biological processes tend to remove, or clear, the substance from the organ. In many cases, this clearance has been found to occur at a roughly exponential rate, so that the amount remaining varies with time as e where Ab is called the biological decay constant. The quantity 0.693 (Tl/2h =-­Ab (9.35) is termed the biological half-life of the substance in the organ. Several values of (T 1/2h are also given in the table. If the amount of Co of a nonradioactive substance is taken into the body at time t = 0, it follows that the amount remaining in a particular organ at time t later is given by (9.36) The function R(t) is known as the retention function. Computations of internal doses to organs usually fall into two categor ies: an individual either inhales or ingests a specified amount of radionuclides in a single intake, or the intake occurs at a more or less constant rate over a long period. These two cases will be discussed in tum. Case 1. Single intake: dose commitment Consider the intake of Co/LCi of a radionuclide at the time t = o. The activity in the target organ rises quickly as the nuclide accumulates there and then dies away due both to its biolog­ ical clearance and the radioactive decay of the nuclide. The activity at time t can be written as where C(t) = Coqe- x e (9.37) (9.38)

Equation (9.38) can also be put in the fonn 1 1 1 --- = --+ ---, (T1/2)eff TI/2 (TI/2h (9.39) where (T1/2)eff is called the effective half-life of the nuclide in the organ in question. From Eq. (9.34), the dose-equivalent rate to the organ is (9.40) decreasing in time, as one would expect. The total dose to the organ from the intake of Co is called the dose commitment, because, aside from death or surgery, there is nonnally no way to prevent the organ from receiving that dose. This dose can be found by integrating Eq. (9.40) over the expected lifetime, tl, of the individual following the intake: H = 51.1::o�q 1'1 e-",I dt 51.1 Co�q (l _ e-Aetl)rem. MAe (9.4l) If either the biological or radiological half-lives of the nuclide are short compared to the expected lifetime of the person, then Eq. (9.4l) reduces to 51.1 Co�q H = rem. MAe (9.42) It should be observed that the dose commitment is directly proportional to the magnitude of the intake and, in the case of Eq. (9.42), is independent of the point in the person's lifetime when the intake occurs. It follows that Eq. (9.42), where it applies, can be used for any time-varying dose where the total intake is Co, pro­ vided that the duration of intake is short compared to the subject's lifetime. Thus, it clearly makes no difference in his total dose commitment whether an individual takes in a total of 1 jLCi of 131 I, for which Eq. (9.42) applies, in one shot or spreads his intake of the 1 jLCi over a year. The dose commitment will be the same. The quantity H / Co computed from either Eq. (9.41) or (9.42) is called the dose-commitment factor, or DCF. Using Eq. (9.42), this factor is given by 51.1 �q DCF = rem/ jLCi. MAe (9.43) In view of the derivation of this fonnula, � has units of MeV, M is in g, and Ae is in (day)-l This factor, which is widely tabulated, is handy for making dose calculations, as illustrated in the next example.

Using Eq. (9.43) then gives 51.1 x 0.23 x 0.23 DCF = 20 x 0.0912 = 1.48 rem/ MCL [Ans.] b) At the given breathing rate, the person would inhale a total of m3 Ci sec 2.32 x 10-4-x 2 X 10-9 -x 2 hr x 3,600-= 3.34 x 10-9 Ci sec m3 hr = 3.34 X 10-3 MCi. This person's dose commitment is then H = 1.48 x 3.34 x 10-3 = 4.94 X 10-3 rem = 4.94 mrem. [Ans.] Case 2. Continuous intake Consider next the situation in which Cd /-L Ci/day of a radionuclide is inhaled or ingested on a continuous basis. During the interval dr at r, Cddr /-LCi is taken into the body. The amount of the radionuclide remaining in a given organ at the later time t is then Cdqe-Ae(t-r) dr, where use has been made of Eq. (9.37). The total quantity of the radionuclide in the organ at the time t due to the daily intake from r = 0 to r = t is

(9.34), which gives . 51.1 Cd�q A H = (l -e et) rem/day. MAe (9.45) According to Eq. (9.45), the dose rate rises steadily from the beginning of the radionuc1ide intake. If both TI/2 and (T1/2h are short compared to a person's expected lifetime, the exponential in Eq. (9.45) eventually dies out, and if reaches the steady-state value . 51.1Cd�q H = rem/day. MAe (9.46) This is the maximum dose rate that can be obtained from a steady intake of Cd ttCi/day. These results will now be applied to the detennination of standards for the intake of radionuc1ide s. 9.10 STANDARDS FOR INTAKE OF RADIONUCL IDES As described in Section 9.8, standard s-setting bodies have established maximum doses that may be accumula ted over specified periods for each body organ or com­ bination of organs. Based on these standards, it is possible to specify the maximum intake of radionuc1ides, which if not exceeded, will not violate the dose standards. These maximum intakes can be detennined in two different ways. Maximum Permissible Concentration Intake standards are often stated in tenns of maximum permissible concentration (MPC). For radiation workers this is defined as the maximum concentration of a radionuc1ide in air or water that at no time over a 50-year period (as long as any working lifetime starting at age 18) from the onset of constant daily intake provides a dose equivalent rate to any organ in excess of the maximum pennissible dose rate for that organ. According to Eq. (9.45) and as illustrated in Fig. 9.13, the dose rate from radionuc1ides taken on a daily basis, whose radioactive or biological half-lives are much less than 50 years, will reach the maximum if = MPD long

On the other hand, radionuc1ides whose radioactive and biological half-lives are much longer than 50 years will deliver the maximum if on the final day of the 50 years. In either case, if decreases following the end of the permitted intake period. To obtain an explicit expression for MPC, it is necessary to place t = to = 50 years in Eq. (9.45), set if equal to the appropriate MPC and write the daily intake Cd in terms of the MPC. For the MPC of a radionuc1ide in water written (MPC)w, Cd is (9.47) where V w is the average daily intake of water via ingestion. Similarly, (9.48) where Va is the daily intake of air via respiration. Introducing these quantities into Eq.

However, if the radionuclide goes to different organs with different MPDs, then the actual (MPC)w and (MPC)a are given by the smallest of the values computed from Eqs.

(9.49) and (9.50) are based on the simplifying assumption that nuclides clear body organs exponentially (i.e., that the retention function is given by Eq. [9.36]). In fact, the movement of radionuclides within the body is generally much more complex, and accurate calculations of MPDs often require the use of complica ted physiological transport models. An abridged tabulation of (MPC)(w) and (MPC)a, originally computed by the ICRP22 and later modified and adopted by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission,23 is given in Table 9.16. It will be observed that these MPCs are specified for persons whose occupational exposure is 40 hrs/wk and also for the general pUblic. The use of Eqs.

 text: Sec. 9.10 Standards for Intake of Radionuclides 529 Example 9.11 It has been found that tritium, whether inhaled or ingested, ultimately appears in equal concentrations in the blood, urine, sweat, and saliva. Therefore, Tritium, as HTO, can be assumed to mix freely with all of the body water and to metabolize in the same way as ordinary water. If the Standard Man (as defined by the ICRP) contains 43 liters of H20, drinks 2,200 cm3 of H20 per day, and produces inter­ nally another 300 cm3 by oxidation every day, what is the (MPC)w for tritium for occupational exposure and for the general public? Solution. Tritium undergoes ,B-decay with a half-life of 12.3 years. There are no y-rays. The value of Emax is 0.018 MeV, so that E :::: 0.3 x 0.018 = 0.0054 MeV. Because Emax is less than 0.03 MeV, Q = 1.7 (see Table 9.2), and � = 0.0054 x 1.7 = 0.0092, or about 0.01, as given in Table 9.15. Because the tritium is unifonnly distributed throughout the body water, it gives, in effect, a whole-body dose. According to Table 9.13, the relevant MPD is then 0.1 rem/week, or 0.01428 rem/day, delivered to 43 liters of water having a mass M = 4.3 X 104 g. The retention function R (t) can be found in the following way: The clearance of tritium from the body can be represented as in Fig. 9.14 by a tank containing V = 43 liters of water with a water throughput of r = 2,500 cm3/day. Now, let m be the total mass of tritium in V at any time following a single intake of tritium at t = O. Then, it is not difficult to see that m decreases according to the rate equation dm dt = mr V (9.51) This equation has the same fonn as the equation detennining the decay of a radioac­ tive nuclide, and it follows that tritium is cleared exponentially. Thus, R(t) is given by (9.52) where Ab is the factor multiplying m on the right side ofEq. (9.51); that is, Tank volume 43 liters r 2,500 1 Ab = -= = 0.0581 day-V 4.3 x 104 2,500 cm3/day - ----------' Figure 9.14 Diagram of throughput of water in the body.

 text: 530 Radiation Protection Chap. 9 which corresponds to a biological half-life of 0.693 Tb = 0.0581 = 11.9 days. Because Tl/2 and (Tl/2h are much less than 50 years, the exponential in Eq. (9.49) can be ignored. Furthermore, Ab » A, so that Ae � Ab. Equation (9.49) can then be written as AbM(MPD) (MPC)w = -5-1.-1-V-w-�q-' Introducing numerical values (q = 1) gives 0.0581 x 4.3 x 104 x 0.01428 (MPC)w = ----------51.1 x 2,200 x 0.01 = 0.032 ItCi/cm3 (9.53) This result is based on the assumption that the intake of tritium is continuous over a 7 -day = 7 x 24 = 168-hour week, and indeed the official (MPC)w for this type of occupational exposure is 0.03 ItCi/cm3, as computed. If, however, a worker is only exposed during a 40-hour week, the pennissible concentration may be higher. It has been found that a worker consumes about one-half of his daily intake of water during an 8-hour working day, so that his exposure while at work can be doubled over that just computed for the same MPD. Furthennore, a worker nonnally works only 5 out of 7 days in the week. The MPC for the 40-hour week is therefore 2 x 7/5 times the MPC for the 1 68-hour week; that is, (MPC)w = 0.03 ItCi/cm3 for a 168-hr week; [Ans.], and (MPC)w = 0.03 x 2 x 7/5 = 0.084 ItCi/cm3 for a 40-hr week. [Ans.] The official (MPC)w for the 40-hour week is rounded off to 0.1 ItCi/cm3 According to Table 9.13, the whole-body MPD for any member of the general public is one-tenth the MPD for occupational exposure. The MPC for the public at large is therefore one-tenth of the MPC for radiation workers and must be calculated on the basis of the full 168-hour week. This is because the public is presumed to be exposed on a continuous basis, if exposed at all. Thus, in the case of tritium, the (MPC)w for the general public is 0.1 x 0.003 ItCi/cm3 [Ans.] Annual Limit on Intake The MPC values in Table 9.16 and others in general use are largely based on calcu­ lations perfonned by the ICRP during the 1950s and reported in ICRP publication 2. Similar calculations using more modem biological and radiological data were

page number: 549
 text: Sec. 9.10 Standards for Intake of Radionuclides 531 carried out in the 1970s and described in ICRP publication 30. So, in the more recent report, the ICRP has abandoned the tenn "maximum permissible concentra­ tion," because in the view of the ICRP: Although the Commission emphasized in ICRP Publication 2 that the rate of intake of a radionuclide could be varied provided that the intake in any quarter was no greater than that resulting from continuous exposure to the appropriate MPC for 13 weeks, the concept of MPC has been misused to imply a maximum concentration in air or water that should never be exceeded under any circumstances. In short, governmental regulatory agencies have tended to take too literally the words "maximum pennissible" in MPC. The ICRP now computes and recommends what it calls the annual limit on intake (ALI) of radionuclides either by ingestion or inhalation. The EPA refers to the ALI as the radioactivity intake factors (RIF). The ICRP also specifies a new quantity, the derived air concentration (DAC), by the relation ALI DAC=-----­air intake per year (9.54) The DAC is essentially the (MPC)a with another name. No comparable concentra­ tion is defined for water, since ICRP argues that water is only one of many sources of ingested materials. The ICRP defines and computes the ALI in a unique and clever fashion. Sup­ pose for the moment that a given radionuclide when ingested or inhaled goes only to one organ and that the entire dose from the radionuclide is confined to that or­ gan. According to ICRP standards, the annual dose to the organ must not exceed some maximum value, Hmax, which is either the 5/WT (cf. Eq. [9.17]) or 50 rems, whichever is smaller. If the radionuclide is taken into the body at the constant rate of I units per year for 50 years, the annual dose to the organ will increase in time until it reaches its maximum value. This will either occur in the 50th year or at some earlier time, depending on the magnitude of its radioactive and biological half-lives. In any event, the dose in no year may exceed Hmax. If HI,so is the dose in year 50 from unit intake in year 1 and H2,so is the dose in year 50 from unit intake in year 2, and so on, the total dose in the 50th year is then H = I (HI,so + H2,so + H2,SO + + Hso,so). (9.55) The ALI is that value of I for which H = Hmax. Because the annual intakes are all the same, Eq. (9.55) can be simplified. The dose in year 50 from the intake during year 2 must be identical to the dose in year 49 from the intake during year 1. That is, H2,so = HI,49.

page number: 550
 text: 532 Radiation Protection Chap. 9 Similarly, and so on. It follows that Eq. (9.55) can also be written as H -I (H1,so + H1,49 + H1,48 + (9.56) The sum in the parenthe ses, however, is simply the 50-year dose commitment aris­ ing from the intake during the first year -or from the intake during any year, since each 50-year dose commitment is the same. If this 50-year dose commitment is denoted by Hso, then the ALI is detennined from the equation Hmax = (ALI)Hso· (9.57) In fact, a radionuclide taken into the body is generally dispersed to a number of organs or tissues. Furthennore, any organ containing a radionuclide necessarily irradiates neighboring organs. In this case, according to the discussion in Section 9.8, the doses HT to the complex of organs must satisfy the conditions and L WT Ht .:s 5 rems T HT .:s 50 rems for all organs. Equation (9.57) can be enlarged to include the more realistic situa­ tion by first defining HSO,T to be the 50-year dose commitment to tissue or organ T per unit intake of radionuclide. The ALI is then defined as the largest value of the intake I which satisfies both of the following relations: and I L WTHT,so .:s 5 rems T I HT,so .:s 50 rems. (9.58) (9.59) Values of ALI for a number of radionuclides based on Eqs. (9.58) and (9.59) are given in Table 9.17. It should be pointed out that the ICRP computations of these ALI are quite complex. The models of biological clearance used are far more complica ted (and realistic) than the simple exponential discussed earlier. At the same time, the computation of doses from one organ to another is not a trivial undertaking. What is more, in the computation of the ALI, the ICRP has taken into ac­ count the fact that different chemical fonns of a given radionuclide may behave

ALI are rounded to two significant figures from ICRP values given in becquerel s. 533 quite differently in the body. For example, the absorption of plutonium by the gas­ trointestinal tract is 10 times smaller for the oxide and hydroxide of plutonium than for other commonly occurring forms of this element. The ALI for the oral intake of plutonium oxides or hydroxides is therefore a factor of 10 larger than that of other chemical forms. Similarly, the uptake and retention of various inhaled chemical compounds may also differ, and the ICRP ALI for inhalation generally depends on the nature of the inhaled compound. The values of ALI given in the table are only the smallest of the ICRP values, so they should be used only when the chemical form of the ingested or inhaled radionuclide is known. Radon Standards Setting standards for the permissible concentration or allowable intake of radon is complicated, because, as discussed in Section 9.7, the bulk of the radiation dose originating in the presence of radon comes from its daughter products, not from the radon itself. What is more, a given concentration of radon does not guarantee any particular concentration of the daughters, for this depends on the extent to which the daughters have reached radioactive equilibrium with the parent radon. In an isolated environment furnished with a constant radon concentration, the daughters eventually come to equilibrium, so that the activities of all the radionuclides in the radon decay chain (see Fig. 9.7) are equal. However, in confined environments such as mines or buildings, only partial equilibrium is ever attained, because the longer­ lived daughters become attached to moisture or dust particles and either diffuse to the walls or are swept out by ventilation in times that are short compared with their half-lives. The concentration of radon and its daughters is frequently stated in terms of a working level (WL), a unit that was developed specifically in connection with

 text: 534 Radiation Protection Chap. 9 measurements of radon/daughter levels in uranium mines. It is defined as any com­ bination of the short-lived daughters of 222Rn in 1 liter of air that will ultimately emit a total of 1.3 x 105 Me V in a-particle energy. It is easily shown that, in equi­ librium, a radon concentration of 100 pCi/1 will produce 1 WL. In practical situ­ ations, the radon daughters are usually not in equilibrium with the 222Rn, so this radon concentration normally gives less than 1 WL. In a typical American home, for instance, 100 pCi/1 of 222Rn provides approximately 0.5 WL, corresponding to about 50% equilibrium. Total exposure to radon daughters in uranium mines is measured in working level months (WLM). Inhalation of air containing a concentration of 1 WL of radon daughters for a total formation 170 hours (the average number of working hours in a month) gives an exposure of 1 WLM. According to EPA estimates based on the linear dose�ffect hypothesis, a one-year exposure to 1 pCi/1 of radon in equilib­ rium with its daughters (i.e., 0.01 WL) gives an added lifetime risk of lung cancer of 100 cases per million exposed individual s. This exposure corresponds to 0.01 WL x 8, 760 hrs/year 7 170 hrs/month = 0.515 WLM. Current US standards limit the occupational exposure of uranium miners to no more than 4 WLM per year. For determination of radon in homes, it is customary to use concentrations of pCill where 4pCill is the average outdoor concentrat ion. Example 9.12 In certain parts of the United States, the radon concentration has been measured at 1 pCill in older uninsulated homes and about 6 pCi/1 in more modem, well-insula ted homes. If a person spends an average of 3,500 hours in his home per year, roughly how many additional cases of lung cancer would result over a period of 50 years from insulating (and not ventilating) one million homes, each with four residents. Solution. At 50% equilibrium, the increased exposure per insulated home would be 3500 hrs exposure 0.5 x 5 pCill x = 1 pCi-year 8760 hrs/year per person. Since 4 x 106 persons are exposed, the total number of cancers over 50 years would be 6 persons exposed 4 x 10 x 50 yr year 100 cases x 6 . x 1 pCi-yr = 20,000.

Both the ICRP and EPA have recommended that in these cases, the combined risk from these doses be no greater than the maxi­ mum risk pennitted from either dose alone. This requirement is met, in the notation of the ICRP, if Hext '" Ij --+ Lt --::s 1, HWb L "ALIJ" , J (9.60) where Hext is the external dose (assumed here to be unifonn), Hwb,L is the annual whole body dose limit of 5 rems, Ij is the annual intake of radionuc1ides of type j, and ALIj is the annual limit of intake of that radionuc1ide. In the notation of the EPA, Eq. (9.60) is Hext L Ij -- --<1 RPG + " RIFj -, J (9.61) where RPG = 5 rems, RIFj = ALIj and the other symbols have the same meaning as in Eq. (9.60). If the external radiation is not uniform, then Hext in Eq. (9.61) is replaced by the usual sum: Hext = L wTHT. (9.62) T Example 9.13 During one year, a radiation worker anticipates receiving a unifonn external dose of 3 rems and simultaneously inhaling some airborne 131 I. How much of the radionu­ elide may the worker inhale if he is not to exceed recommended limits? Solution. From Table 9.17, the ALI for the inhalation of 131 I is 54 J.l,Ci. Substituting this value together with Hext = 3 rems and Hwb,L = 5 rems into Eq. (9.60) gives 3 I 5" = 54 = 1. Solving for I yields I = 22J.l,Ci. [Ans.] 9.11 EXPOSURE FROM ,-RAY SOURCES It is often necessary to calculate exposures and exposure rates from specified dis­ tributions of y-ray sources. Corresponding values of the absorbed dose and dose­ equivalent can then be found using the formulas developed in the preceding section. In this section, a few simple y-ray sources will be considered. Similar calculations for neutron sources, which are always heavily shielded, are more complicated; they will be discussed in the next chapter.

page number: 554
 text: 536 Radiation Protection Chap. 9 In the calculations that follow, it will be assumed that the sources are bare (un­ shielded) and that the points of interest are so close to the sources that attentuation in the air can be neglected. This is the case for most y-ray sources for distances up to about 30 meters. According to the fonnulas derived in Section 9.9, the quantities X, D, and Hand their rates are proportional to the y-ray flux l/>y. It is necessary, therefore , to compute l/>y for each source distribution. Point Source Consider first a point source emitting S y-rays per second isotropically. At the outset, it should be noted that since all the y-rays move in the radial direction, the y-ray flux and intensity are equal. To compute the flux at the distance r frpm the source, it is observed that in the absence of attenuati on, the total number of y-rays passing through a sphere of radius r with the source as center, must be a constant, independent of r. This number is 4n r2 I (r), where I (r )is the intensity at r, and is equal to the source strength S. Thus, and so 4n r2 I (r) = constant = S, S I (r) = l/>y(r) = --2' 4nr (9.63) Equation (9.63) may also be used for small spherical sources, provided that there is no attenuation within the source, but only at distances that are large com­ pared with the radius of the source. At points near a spherical source, all the y-rays do not move radially, which is the assumption upon which Eq. (9.63) is based. Line Source Consider next an infinite line source emitting S y-rays/sec isotropically per cen­ timeter of its length. The y-rays emitted from the element of length dz (see Fig. dz z Infinite - line source I-----------"'"- p x Figure 9.15 Diagram for computing flux from infinite line source.

(9.64) between the limits of -11 and 12• It is then easily found that (9.66) This formula is often used to estimate the y-ray exposure from a bare fuel element when it is withdrawn from a reactor. Ring Source Suppose now that the source consists of a ring of radius R and length I = 2n R, which emits isotropically S y-rays/sec per em of length. The S dl y-rays emitted from the length dl of the ring (see Fig. 9.17) emerge as from a point source and give the flux at P

The flux along the axis of the disc can easily be computed; it is somewhat more difficult to calculate the flux at other points. Consider the sources located in the annular region between z and z +d z. These emit 2n Sz dz y-rays/sec, which is equivalent to the emission of Sl y-rays/sec from the source just derived. Thus, from Eq. (9.67), these contribute the flux d¢y at P equal to dz 2n Sz dz Sz dz d¢y(P) = 2 = -2-' 4nr 2r Figure 9.18 Diagram for computing flux from a disc source.

(9.70) that <py(P) increases without limit with increasing R, and it might be concluded that the flux from an infinite sheet of sources is infinite. This is indeed the case in a vacuum (i.e., in the absence of attenuati on). So, when attenuation in the air between the sources and the observation point is included, the flux remains finite, as will be shown in the next chapter. GLOSSARY Absorbed dose.
