 text: 10 Radiation Shielding Radiation shielding serves a number of functions. Foremost among these is reduc­ ing the radiation exposure to persons in the vicinity of radiation sources. Shielding used for this purpose is called biological shielding. This chapter is devoted largely to shielding of this type. Shields are also used in some reactors to reduce the in­ tensity of y-rays incident on the reactor vessel, which protects the vessel from excessive heating due to y-ray absorption and reduces radiation damage due to neutrons. These shields are called thermal shields. Sometimes shields are used to protect delicate electronic apparatus that otherwise would not function properly in a radiation field. Such apparatus shields are used, for example, in some types of military equipment. Ordinarily, it is necessary to shield only against y-raysl and neutrons, not against a-particles or f3-rays. This is because, as shown in Section 3.9, the ranges of charged particles in matter are so short. When a-particle or f3-ray shielding is required, the formulas given in Section 3.9 can be used to calculate thickness. This chapter is divided into two parts. The first is devoted to the biological shielding of y-rays. The second part is concerned with the shielding of reactors-a problem that involves both y-rays and neutrons. In all cases, the central problem I Here, as in Chapter 9, the term y-ray refers to both x-rays and y-rays. 548

 text: Sec. 10.1 Gamma-Ray Shielding: Buildup Factors 549 is to determine the thickness and/or composition of shielding material required to reduce biological dose rates to predetermined levels. Frequently these are the maximum permissible dose rates at certain points, as discussed in Section 9.8, for either occupational or general population exposure. 10.1 GAMMA- RAY SHIELDING: BUILDUP FACTORS Consider a monodirectional beam of y-rays of intensity (or flux)2 <1>0 and energy Eo, which is incident on a slab shield of thickness a as shown in Fig. 10.1. If there is no shield, then according to Eq. (9.20), the exposure rate at P in conventional units is Xo = 0.0659¢oEo(J.1a/ p)airmRlhr, (10.1) where ¢o is in units of y-rays/cm2-sec, Eo is in Me V, and (J.la/ P )air is in cm2/g and is evaluated at the energy Eo. It is convenient to write Eq. (10.1) in the form where Xo = C¢o, C = 0.0659Eo(J.1a/ p)air (10.2) (10.3) is a function of Eo. With the shield in place, the y-ray flux ¢ emerging from the shield is different from ¢o, and the problem of determing the actual value of X at P reduces to computing ¢. It would be easy to compute ¢ if every time a photon interacted with matter it disappeared. Then ¢ would be equal to the flux of uncollided y-rays (1004) where J.l is the total attenuation coefficient at the energy Eo. Unfortunately, y-rays do not disappear at each interaction. In the Compton effect, for instance, they are ¢o---ep Figure 10.1 Monodirectional beam of y-rays incident on slab shield. 2Because the beam is monodirectional, the flux and intensity are equal in this example.

Even in the photoelectric effect and in pair production, although the incident photon is absorbed, x-rays are usually produced subsequent to the photoelectric effect, and annihilation radiation inevitably follows after pair production. As a result, a monoenergetic beam incident on a shield as in Fig. 10.1, with an energy spectrum like that depicted in Fig. 10.2, emerges from the shield with a continuous spectrum as shown in Fig. 10.3. In this figure, the sharp peak at Eo corresponds to the unscattered photons and is reduced in size over the peak in Fig. 10.2 by the exponential factor in Eq. (l0.4). For the most part, the continuous part of the spectrum is due to Compton-sca ttered photons, with some contribution from photoelectric x-rays and annihilation radiation. The exact calculation of a spectrum like that shown in Fig. 10.3 is difficult and well beyond the scope of this text. It must suffice at this point merely to state that such calculations of 4>(E) have been carried out for a variety of shielding materials as a function of the incident y-ray energy and shield thickness. The computed values of 4>(E) are then used to compute the exposure rate from the formula Figure 10.3 Energy spectrum of y-rays emerging from shield.

 text: Sec. 10.1 Gamma-Ray Shielding: Buildup Factors 551 (10.5) The results of these computations are written as X = XoBm(J.Ia)e-/La, (10.6) where Xo is the exposure rate in the absence of the shield as given by Eq. (10.1), Bm (J.Ia) is called the exposure buildup factor for a monodirectional beam, and J.I is again the total attenuation coefficient at the energy Eo. Values of Bm are given in Table 10.1 as a function of energy for several ma­ terials.3 It is observed from this table that the numerical values of Bm can be very large, which shows the importance of the buildup of scattered radiation in shield­ ing calculations. With a water shield, for example, which is J.Ia = 10 mean free paths thick4 at 2 Me V, Bm is approximately equal to 10. This means that if buildup is omitted from a calculation of the effectiveness of such a shield, the resulting exposure rate is in error by a factor of 10. Therefore , the buildup factor cannot be ignored. Since Bm is a continuous function of atomic number, values of Bm for materials not given in the table can be obtained by plotting Bm versus Z for the en­ ergy in question and interpolating from the curve. Equation (10.6) gives the actual exposure rate at the point P, behind the shield, in Fig. 10.1. According to Eq. (10.1), Xo is proportional to <Po, and it is reasonable, by analogy, to write X in the same fonn-n amely, (10.7) where C is again given by Eq. (10.3). The quantity <Ph is called the buildup flux and is clearly equal to the flux of monoenergetic y-rays of energy Eo. Eo gives the same exposure rate at P in Fig. 10.1 as the actual y-ray flux at that point. Introducing Eqs. (10.2) and (10.7) into Eq. (10.6) shows that or equivalently <Ph = <Pu Bm (J.Ia), where <Pu is the uncollided flux of Eq. (10.4). (10.8) 3These buildup factors were originally called dose buildup factors and were actually computed for infinite media. However, the differences between the buildup factors for infinite media and slabs of finite thickness are ordinarily negligible except for light media, such as H20, and low energies­ less than about 1 Me V. 4Since JW = a/A, where A is the photon mean free path, it follows that /La is equal to the thickness of the shield in mean free paths computed at the energy of the incident photons.

 text: Sec. 10.1 Gamma-Ray Shielding: Buildup Factors 553 Example 10.1 A monodirectional beam of 2-MeV y-rays of intensity 106 y-rays/cm2-sec is in­ cident on a lead shield 10 cm thick. At the rear side of the shield calculate the: (a) uncollided flux; (b) buildup flux; (c) exposure rate. Solution. 1. From Table 11.4, fJ.,/ p = 0.0457 cm2/ g for lead at 2 MeV. Then since p = 11.34 g/cm3, fJ., = 0.0457 x 11.34 = 0.518 cm-I, and fJ.,a = 0.518 x 10 = 5.18. From Eq. (l0.4), ¢u = 106e-5.18 = 106 x 5.63 X 10-3 = 5.63 x 103y-rays/cm2-sec. [Ans.] 2. The buildup factor at 2 Me V for fJ.,a = 5.18 must be found by interpolating between the values given in Table 10.1 for fJ.,a = 4 and fJ.,a = 7. The result is Bm = 2.78. The buildup flux is therefore ¢b = ¢uBm(fJ.,a) = 5.63 x 103 x 2.78 = 1.56 x 104y-rays/cm2-sec. [Ans.] 3. The value of k is then k = C¢b = 0.0659Eo(fJ.,a/ p)air¢b, where Eo = 2 MeV and (fJ.,a/ p)air is evaluated at this energy. From Table 11.5, (fJ.,a/ p ) air = 0.0238 cm2/ g, so that k = 0.0659 x 2 x 0.0238 x 1.56 x 104 = 48.8 mRlhr. [Ans.] An alternate and probably easier way to obtain the result in part (c) is to note from Fig. 9.9 that, at 2 MeV, a y-ray flux of 3.2 x 102 gives an exposure rate of 1 mRlhr. In the present case, therefore, . 1.56 x 104 X = 3.2 X 102 = 48.8 mRlhr. [Ans.] The prior discussion pertains exclusively to a monodirectional beam nor­ mally incident on a slab shield, and the buildup factor Bm (f.-La) can be used only in problems of this type. Buildup factors have also been computed for other types of shielding problems. For instance, consider a point isotropic source emitting S y-rays/sec surrounded by a spherical shield of radius R. In this case, the exposure rate at a point on the surface of the shield is written as (10.10) Here B p (f.-LR) is the point isotropic exposure buildup factor, and ko is the exposure rate in the absence of the shield-specifically, ko = CCPo, (10.11)

 text: 556 Radiation Shieldin g Chap. 10 Solution. In a problem of this type, the first step is to compute the buildup flux that will give the required exposure rate. Thus, ¢b = X 10.0659 E (/-La 1 p )air Here X = I mRlhr, E = I MeV, and from Table 11.5 (/-La 1 p)air = 0.0280 cm2/g. Introducing these values gives ¢b = 1/0.0659 x 1 x 0.0280 = 5.42 x 102y-rays/cm2-sec. Then from Eq. (10.14), which may be written as B (/-LR)e-/l-R 1 = 1.47 X 104----'-P ___ _ R2 This equation must be solved for R, which is easily done by plotting the right-hand side (RHS) of the equation as a function of /-LR. To express RHS in terms of /-LR, the numerator and denominator are multiplied by /-L, obtained from Table 11.4 (/-L = 0.0595 x 7.86 = 0.468 cm-1). This gives (10.15) As shown in Fig. 10.4, the RHS of Eq. (10.15) is almost a straight line when plot­ ted on a semilog graph. From the figure, RHS = 1 for /-LR = 6.55, and so R = 6.55/0.468 = 14.0 cm. [Ans.] For computational purposes, it is convenient to express the tabulated point buildup factor as a mathematical function, and several such functions have been developed. One of the most useful of these is the sum of exponential-namely, (10.16) where AI, A2, aI, and Cl2 are functions of energy. Equation (10.16) is known as the Taylor form of the buildup factor, and it is sufficiently accurate to be used in many practical shielding problems. 5 As rgoes to zero, Bp must approach unity since there can be no buildup of scattered radiation in a shield of zero thickness. It 5 A more accurate representation of B p is the Berger form: Bp = 1 + Cj1-re-fJJU where C and f3 depend on energy. Unfortunately, this expression is somewhat more difficult to use in analytical calculations than the Taylor form.

For larger values of x, En(x) can be computed with sufficient accuracy for most purposes from the following approximate formula: -x [1 n] En(x) � e --+ 3 x+n (x+n) (10.24) When x = 10, this formula gives a value of E1(x), which is only .11% too large; when x = 20, the error is .04%. To return to the problem of the shielded planar source, it is possible to cal­ culate the buildup flux by noting that the contribution to ¢b, due to the differential ring at z, is 6Por tabulations of En (x), see references at the end of the chapter.

What thickness of concrete is required to reduce the exposure rate to 2.5 mRlhr? The concrete density is 2.35 g/cm3.

 text: 562 Radiation Shielding Chap. 10 Solution. From Eqs. (10.3) and (10.7), a value of X = 2.5 mRlhr results from a buildup flux of CPb = X/C = 2.5/0.00659E(J.La/ p)air Here E = 2 MeV, and from Table 11.5, (J.La/ p)air = 0.0238 cm2/g. Introducing these values gives CPb = 2.5/0.0659 x 2 x 0.0238 = 7.97 x 102y-rays!cm2-sec. Next, according to Table 10.3, Al = 18.089; A2 = 1 -Al = -17.089; al = -0.04250, so that 1 + at = 0.9575; and a2 = 0.00849, so that 1 + a2 = 1.00849. Thus, from Eq. (10.26), 109 7.97 X 102 = T[18.089E1(0.9575J.La) -17.089EI(1.00849J.La)] (10.27) must be solved for J.La. The value of a, the required shield thickness, can then be found using the value of J.L for concrete computed at 2 Me V from Table II.4-namely, J.L = 0.0445 x 2.35 = 0.1046 cm-I Equation (10.27) can be solved either graphically or numerically. If the for­ mer method is adopted, the computations can be speeded up by first simplifying the equation-namely, 1 = 1.13 x 107[E I (0.9575J.La) -0.94E I (1.00849J.La)] (10.28) and then plotting the RHS of the equation as a function of J.La on a semilog graph as in Example 10.2. As indicated in Fig. 10.7, the reSUlting curve is almost linear, at least over short distances. According to the figure, RHS = 1 for J.La = 13.6, and so a = 13.6/0.1046 = 130 cm or about 4i ft. [Ans.] In the foregoing calculations, the flux was evaluated at a point on the shield surface. Suppose, however, that the point P is actually located at the distance s] from the shield and that the shield, in turn, is some distance X2 from the source as shown in Fig. 10.8. Then the unCOllided flux from a ring of width dz at Z is 2rr Sz dze-ws d<pu = 4 2 ' rrr where rs is that portion of r located within the shield, and so <Pu is S 100 ze-Ws dz <Pu = -. 2 0 r2 (10.29)

Consider next a disc source of radius R like that discussed in Section 9.11, emitting S photons/cm 2-sec, but now shielded by a slab of thickness a as shown in Fig. 10.10. The uncollided and buildup fluxes at the point P on the axis of the disc can be computed as in the infinite planar case by integrating the contributions from differential rings. Thus, <t>u is given by Eq.

 text: Sec. 10.3 The Line Source 567 The integral in Eq. (10.35) cannot be evaluated analytically, but it can be expressed in terms of the Sievert integral function. This is a function of two variables defined as F(B, x) = 10 e-xsecO dB, (10.36) where e is restricted to values less than n /2. Figure 10.12 shows F (e, x) as a function of x for several values of e. 8 It is observed that F (e , x) decreases more or less exponentially with x and increases with e. For large values of e (near n /2) and x, F (e, x) can be computed from the formula f[; -x ( 5 ) F(e, x) � -e 1 --2x 8x (10.37) Finally, it should be noted that, since sec ( -e) = sec e, the integrand in Eq. (10.36) is an even function of e; since the integral of an even function is always an odd function, it follows that F(-e,x) = -F(e,x). (10.38) In view of these properties of F(e, x), Eq. (10.35) for the uncollided flux at P can be written as (10.39) The calculation of the buildup flux is essentially the same in this problem as in the slab and disc problems discussed earlier. Thus, <Ph is given by <Ph = � LAn j(h e-(l+an)J,LR sec 0 de 4n R -OJ S = 4n R LAn {F[e1, (1 + an)JLR] + F[e2, (1 + an)JLR]). (10.40) Numerical calculations utilizing Eq. (10.40) can be carried out in much the same way as illustrated in Example 10.3 for the slab shield. In particular, if the shield thickness must be determined, then it is usually helpful to plot the log of the RHS of Eq. (10.40). The resulting curve is then virtually a straight line. If the observation point P is located beyond the surface of the shield at the distance R from the source, and the shield radius is a where a < R, then it is not difficult to show that (10.41) 8Consult the references for tabulations of this function.

 text: Sec. 10.4 Internal Sources 571 10.4 INTERNAL SOURCES Circumstances often arise in which y-ray sources are distributed in the interior of attenuating media. This occurs, for example, in shields for reactors. Energetic fission neutrons inelastically scattered within the shield give rise to sources of in­ elastic y-rays, while thermalized neutrons undergo radioactive capture and produce capture y -rays. Reactor shields must include provisions for the shielding against such secondary y-rays. Consider a slab of thickness a containing sources of y-rays emitting Sex) photons/cm 3 -sec at the distance x as shown in Fig. 10.14.

 text: Sec. 10.5 Multilayered Shields 573 For an arbitrary source distribution S(r') in a volume of arbitrary shape, the y-ray flux at the point r on the surface can be found by evaluating the integral 1 f S(r')e-JL1r-r'l <P (r) -- dV' u -4JT Ir -r'12 (10.57) over the source volume. This can be done either on a computer or by a hand cal­ culation using the following straightforward method. First, the source volu me' is divided into convenient subvolumes �, which need not be the same size. The num­ ber of y -rays Si emitted from Vi is then computed from the source function. The contributions to the flux from each volume are then added, taking Si to be a point source. The result for the buildup flux is _ 1 '"' Sj B p (ILrde-Wi <Ph --4 � 2 ' JT ri where rj is the distance from some point in Vi to the observation point. 10.5 MULTILAYERED SHIELDS (10.58) The y-ray shields discussed so far have all consisted of single regions of shielding materials. It is now necessary to consider shields composed of more than one layer of material. For example, suppose that a monodirectional beam of y-rays of energy Eo is incident on a shield having two layers of different materials as shown in Fig. 10.15. It is not difficult to see that the uncollided flux at the point P is (10.59) where ILl and 1L2 are the total attenuation coefficients of the first and second layers and al and a2 are their respective thicknesses. The calculation of the buildup flux at P poses a more difficult problem. This stems from the fact that buildup factors have been computed only for monoener­ getic y-rays incident on various materials. Although these buildup factors can be ¢Jo ---- .p Figure 10.15 y-rays incident on layered shield.

page number: 592
 text: 574 Radiation Shielding Chap. 10 used to describe the radiation leaving the first layer in Fig. 10.15, they are not ap­ propriate for the radiation leaving the second layer. The radiation incident on this layer has a continuous spectrum resulting from interactions in the first layer. Fur­ thermore, the buildup flux at P can clearly be expected to depend on which of the two layers comes first. A monoenergetic flux incident on the first region, and pro­ ducing a continuous spectrum incident on the second, gives one value of ¢b at P There is no reason to believe that if the media are interchanged, then ¢b will be the same. Indeed, the two values of ¢b are, in general, quite different. Consider, for example, 0.5-MeV y-rays incident on layers composed of lead and water. From Table 10.1, it is seen that the buildup factor of water is much larger than that of lead for the same thickness. It follows that there is a greater buildup of low-energy scattered radiation in water than in lead. This is because, in water, the low-energy radiation propagates with little photoelectric absorption. Owing to its high value of Z, photoelectric absorption is important in lead at low energies and a buildup of low-energy radiation is not possible. If the water is placed before the lead, the buildup radiation from the water is absorbed as it passes through the lead, and the overall buildup through the shield is small. However, if the lead is placed first, the subsequent buildup of radiation in the water will reach the observer and the overall buildup is larger. There is no simple way to obtain the exact value of the buildup factor for a layered shield in terms of the buildup factors of each layer. Approximate values can be obtained using the following recipes, which are based on qualitative arguments. In every instance, the method can be expected to give reasonable answers. 1. If the media are alike-that is, their Z s do not differ by more than 5 to 10- then use the buildup factor of the medium for which this factor is the larger and compute the overall buildup factor as B(J-tl, al + J-t2a2). This rule is based on the observation that, except at low energy, the buildup factors do not vary rapidly with the Z of the medium. 2. If the media are different, with the low-Z medium first, then use the buildup factor of the second medium as if the first medium is not there-that is, use BZ2 (J-t2a2). This is because the low-energy buildup radiation from region I is absorbed in region 2. 3. If the media are different, with the high-Z medium first, the procedure to follow in this case depends on whether the y-ray energy is above or below the minimum in the J-t-curve, which occurs at about 3 Me V for heavy elements. If E < 3 MeV, then (10.60) This is because the energy of the photons emerging from a high-Z shield is little different from that of the source, and in the second medium the photons can

page number: 593
 text: Sec. 10.5 Multilayered Shields be treated as if they were source y-rays. However, if E > 3 MeV, then B = BzI (lLlaI) x Bz2(1L2a2)min, 575 (10.61) where Bz2(1L2a2) is the value of BZ2 at 3 MeV. Equation (10.61) is based on the fact that the y-rays penetrating the first layer have energies clustered about the minimum in IL, so that their penetration through the second layer is determined by this energy rather than by the actual source energy. It must be emphasized again that the previous recipes give only approximate results for the attenuation of y-rays in layered shields. They are to be used in the absence of exact calculations. Example 10.4 A monodirectional beam of 6-MeV y-rays of intensity 102 y-rays/cm2-sec is to be shielded with 100 cm of water and 8 cm of lead. Compute the exposure rate if (a) the water is placed before the lead, (b) the water follows the lead. Solution. In both cases, the buildup flux is given by where Bm is the appropriate monodirectional buildup factor-xw 100 cm and XPb = 8 cm. From Table 1.4, /-lw = 0.0275 and /-lPb = 0.4944, so that /-lwXw = 2.75 and /-lPbXPb = 3.96. For case (a), the value of Bm is that of lead alone where use has been made of Table 10.1. Then <Pb is <Pb = 106 x 1.86e-(2.75+3.96) = 2.27 x 103y-rays/cm2-sec. According to Fig. 9.9, a flux of 150 6-MeV y-rays/cm2-sec gives an exposure rate of 1 mRlhr. Thus, in case (a), . 2.27 x 103 X = 150 x 1 = 15.1 mRlhr. [Ans.]. In case (b), Bm is given by Eq. (10.61): Bm = Bpb(3.96) x Bw(2.75), where Bw(2.75) is evaluated at about 3.2 MeV-the minimum in the /-lPb curve. Thus, from Table 10.1, Bw(2.75) = 2.72 and BPb(3.96) is again 1.86, so that Bm = 1.86 x 2.72 = 5.06.

 text: 576 Radiation Shielding The buildup flux is then ¢b = 106 x 5.06e-(2.75+3.96) = 6.17 x 103y-rays/cm2-sec. The exposure rate in this case is then . 6.17 x 103 X = x 1 = 41.1 mRlhr. [Ans.] 150 Chap. 10 The exposure rate is thus smaller when the y-rays traverse the water before the lead. 10.6 NUCLEAR REACTOR SHIELDING: PRINCIPL ES OF REACTOR SHIELDING This part of the chapter concerns the design of the biological shields that must be placed around a nuclear reactor and at various points in a nuclear power plant to protect operating personnel and the public at large from the radiations emanating from the installation. The following sources of radiation are to be considered. Prompt Fission Neutrons Emitted from the core, these constitute the most important radiation to be considered in designing a biological shield. Delayed Fission Neutrons Ordinarily these are not an important con­ sideration because, on the one hand, there are so few of them and, on the other, their energies are so low (on the order of 400 keY). Delayed neutrons can lead to special shielding problems in circulating fuel reactors like the molten salt breeder reactor (see Section 4.5). In that system, the delayed neutron precursors are carried outside of the core with the moving fuel, and some of the delayed neutrons are emitted there. Prompt Fission y-Rays Emitted in the core, these y-rays are largely attenuated by the materials in the core. Fission Product Decay y-Rays Emitted from the fuel, these y-rays are a continuing source of radiation after the shutdown of a reactor. Inelastic y -Rays These are y -rays emitted by nuclei that have been left in excited states as the result of inelastic neutron scattering. Since inelastic scattering occurs only with energetic neutrons, the inelastic y-rays tend to be emitted from the reactor core and from inner portions of the shield where the nel.ltrons (ll'e most energetic. Capture y -Rays These are emitted each time a neutron is absorbed by a nucleus in a radiative capture reaction. This reaction is most probable at resonance and thermal energies. Since thermal neutrons are usually present in a reactor shield, the shield may be a source of capture y-rays.

 text: Sec. 10.6 Nuclear Reactor Shielding: Principles 577 Activation y-Rays These y-rays are emitted by radioactive nuclides formed as the result of neutron absorption. Much of the internal structure of a re­ actor becomes radioactive in this way, and so does the coolant and any extraneous atoms contained in the coolant. Such radionuclides, contained in and/or picked up and carried along by the coolant, may be deposited along the piping and in equipment located in the primary coolant loop. As a result, these parts become sources of activation y-rays that require shielding. In practice, it is found that, among all of these radiation sources, the prompt fission neutrons are the most difficult to shield against. Unfortunately, it is not pos­ sible to absorb fast neutrons. Absorption cross-sections are simply too small at high energies. What is done, therefore, is first to slow the fast neutrons down to thermal energies and then to absorb the thermal neutrons. In this connection, it is recalled from Section 3.5 that, on average, neutrons lose 50% of their energy in an elastic collision with hydrogen-more than with any other nucleus. For this reason, hy­ drogen is one of the principal components of every reactor shield. Water, with its high hydrogen content, and other materials containing water are often employed to shield reactor installations. Most of the shielding in stationary nuclear power plants is ordinary concrete, which contains approximately lOw /0 water and has a hydro­ gen atom density equal to about one quarter that of water. Concrete is inexpensive, structurally sound, and readily formed into any desired shape. Shields designed to attenuate very fast neutrons, such as those emitted from accelerator sources or those emitted from fusion reactions (see Example 2.8 and Section 2.11), often contain moderately heavy or heavy materials to slow down the neutrons by inelastic scattering. This process is surprisingly effective. Thus, it can be shown that the average energy E' of a neutron emerging from an inelastic collision with a nucleus of mass number A is given approximately by the formula -fE E' = 6.4'1 A' (10.62) where E is the energy of the incident neutron and both E' and E are in MeV. Suppose that a 14-MeV neutron is inelastically scattered by iron (A = 56). Then from Eq. (10.62), E' = 3 MeV. This represents an average energy loss of 11 MeV, which is substantially more than the neutron would have lost in an elastic collision even with hydrogen. Iron and other heavy materials have also been used extensively in reactor shields-either in solid sheets or distributed uniformly in concrete, but more for the purpose of attenuating y-rays than for slowing down neutrons. The average energy of fission neutrons is evidently too low to have inelastic scattering playa significant role in slowing down neutrons in reactor shields. It can be shown that when a shield is divided into alternating regions of, say, iron and a hydrogenous material such as concrete or polyethylene, so that the attenuation of the y-rays and

 text: 578 Radiation Shielding Chap. 10 neutrons proceeds at the same rate through successive layers, the overall size and weight of the shield is less than that of a concrete or polyethylene shield alone. This can be an important consideration for mobile nuclear power systems where space and weight are at a premium. With stationary power plants, space is not a crucial matter, and simple concrete shielding is cheaper to build. Once the fast neutrons have been thermalized in a shield, they must then be absorbed. However, when thermal neutrons are captured in water, a 2.2-MeV y­ ray is emitted as the result of the 1 H(n,y )2H reaction. If they are captured by iron, however, a 7.6-MeV and a 9.3-MeV y-ray are emitted. The exposure rates from these y-rays outside the shield can be quite significa nt especially if the shield is not thick. To reduce the intensity of such y-rays, boron-either natural or enriched­ is sometimes added to reactor shields. Boron has a high thermal absorption cross­ section (759 b), which is due mostly to the lOB(n,a)7Li reaction. Although y-rays do accompany this reaction, they have a relatively low energy of about 0.5 MeV. 10.7 REMOVAL CROSS·SEC TIONS Important experiments bearing on the attenuation of fission neutrons in water were carried out some years ago at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and have since been repeated elsewhere. The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 10.16. Thermal neutrons from a reactor fall onto a disc of enriched uranium, about 28 in. in di­ ameter, which is located at the end of a large tank of water. The thermal neutrons induce fissions in the uranium, and in this way the disc becomes a source of fission neutrons in water.

The flux of fast neutrons- that is, neutrons with energies greater than about 1 Me V-is then measured in the water as a function of distance from the source. From these measurements , it is possible to infer the fast flux in water from a point isotropic fission source. Thus, let G (r) be the flux at the distance r from a point fission source emitting one fission neutron per sec isotropically. This function is known as the point water kernel. Using the methods given earlier in this chapter (see Section 10.2), it is easy to see that the flux at the distance x from the center of a fission plate of radius R emitting neutrons per cm2/sec is given by ¢(x) = 2rr S LR G(r)z dz, (10.63) where z is the distance from the center of the disc to a ring of width dz emitting 2rr Sz dz neutrons/sec. By inverting this integral, G(r) can be found from measured values of 4J(x). The results of these measurements and calculations are shown in Fig. 10.17, where 4rrr2G(r) is given as a function of distance from the source. It is observed that, beyond about 40 em, the curve becomes almost a straight line so that G (r) can be written as 'i:' � N .... t= � 10° 10-i'.. • � 10-2 10-3 10-4 l'\..

 text: 580 Radiation Shieldin g Chap. 10 The constants have the values A = 0.12 and bRW = 0.103 cm-This form of G (r) suggests that, beyond about 40 cm, the neutrons are absorbed with an ef­ fective macroscopic absorption cross-section of bRW. What is happening, however, is that the neutrons are being removed from the group of neutrons with energies greater than 1 MeV as the result of scattering in the water, and 1:RW is called the macroscopic removal cross-section of water. To understand these results physically, consider those fission neutrons emit­ ted from a point source and headed in the direction of the detector. If one of these neutrons suffers a collision with hydrogen, its energy, on average, is reduced by one-half. Owing to the rapid increase in the cross-section of hydrogen with de­ creasing energy, as indicated in Fig. 10.18, the mean free path for its next collision is greatly shortened. As a consequence, the neutron has its second collision near the site of its first, whereon its energy and mean free path are again reduced, and so on. In this way, the energy of the neutron eventually falls below 1 MeV. However, because of the continually decreasing mean free path, this occurs not far from the location of the first collision. Thus, it follows that a single collision with hydrogen effectively removes a neutron from among the fast neutrons entering the detector. Scattering from the oxygen in water is complica ted by the fact that this nu­ cleus tends to scatter neutrons preferentially through small angles. Neutrons scat­ tered at such angles may continue to the detector. However, neutrons scattered at large angles by oxygen are lost because they subsequently suffer collisions with hy­ drogen and are thereby removed. Thus, a single collision with hydrogen and all but forward scattering collisions with oxygen effectively remove fast neutrons from water.

(10.64) is also valid for concrete, although the value of the removal cross-section is sensitive to the amount of water present in this material. To return to the Oak Ridge experiments, these were repeated with slabs of various thicknesses placed in front of the fission plate as shown in Fig. 10.16. When these data are related to an equivalent experiment with a point fission source surrounded by varying thicknesses of materials, it is found that the fast neutron flux can be expressed by the formula (10.65) Here S is the source strength, G (r) is the point water kernel, � R is the macroscopic removal cross-section for the material in question, and t is its thickness. Measured values of �R for several materials are given in Table 10.4. The explanation of Eq. (10.65) is similar to the interpretation of the water ker­ nel given earlier. Thus, it is only those fission neutrons emitted in the direction of the detector that have the best chance of reaching it. Any of the neutrons that inter­ act in the material surrounding the source, except those that are scattered through small angles, are removed from the beam heading for the detector. Their second and succeeding collisions are with water, and they slow out of the fast flux in these collisions by the mechanism discussed earlier. The removal cross-section is thus equivalent to an absorption cross-section, at least as far as the fast neutrons are concerned. In this connection, it is important to recognize that the removal cross- TABLE 10.4 REMOVAL CROSS -SECTIONS Macroscopic Microscopic cross-section, cross-section, Material cm-1 b Hydrogen 1.00 Deuterium 0.92 Beryllium 0.132 1.07 Boron 0.97 Carbon 0.065 0.81 Oxygen 0.92 Sodium 0.032 1.26 Iron 0.168 1.98 Zirconium 0.101 2.36 Lead 0.118 3.53 Uranium 0.174 3.6 Water 0.103 Heavy Water 0.092 Concrete* 0.089 *Containing 6% water by weight.

It is of such a thickness to ensure that a neutron interacting in the material is, in fact, lost from the fast flux. If the atom density of the shielding material is N, then it is possible to write (10.66) where aR is the microscopic removal cross-section. Values of aR for several nuclei are given in Table 10.4. The macroscopic removal cross-section for a mixture of elements is obtained in the usual way from the formula (10.67) where Ni and aRi are the atom density and microscopic removal cross-section for the ith species. Example 10.5 A fission plate 28 in. in diameter in a tank of water operates at a fission density of 4 x 107 fissions/cm2-sec. (a) Calculate the fast flux at a point P, 75 cm from the center of the plate. (b) Repeat the calculation with a 3-in slab of iron placed in front of the plate. Solution. 1. It is first necessary to derive an expression for the fast flux as a function of distance from the plate. This is given by Eq. (10.63): ",(xl = 2rrS foR G(rlzdz.

(10.64) gives SA lxsece e-I:RWr ¢(x) = - --dr 2 x r SA = 2[E1 (�RWX) - El (�RWX sec e)]. 583 To evaluate ¢(x), the values of S and sec e are required. Since v = 2042 fission neutrons are emitted per fission, it follows that S = 2042 x 4 x 107 = 9.68 X 107 neutrons/cm 2-sec. Also, tan e = 14 x 2.54/75 = 00474, so that e = 00443 radians and sec e = 1.107. Then �RWX = 0.103 x 75 = 7.73 and �RWX sec e = 8.55. Thus, the fast flux is equal to 9.68 x 107 x 0.12 ¢(P) = 2 [E1 (7.73) - El (8.55)] = 177 neutrons/cm 2-sec. [Ans.] 2.

From Table lOA, �R = 0.168 cm-1 for iron, and so �Rt = 0.168 x 3 x 2.54 = 1.28. Finally, 9.68 X 107 x 0.12 ¢(P) = 2 [El (9.01) - El (9.97)] = 46.6 neutrons/cm 2-sec. [Ans.] The foregoing problem demonst rates the efficacy of moderately heavy mate­ rials in reducing the flux of fast neutrons, assuming that the materials are followed by a sufficiently thick layer of hydrogenous material that the scattered neutrons are indeed lost from the fast flux. Shielding material placed near the outer surface of a water shield is not nearly as effective in attenuating fast neutrons.

 text: 584 Radiation Shieldin g Chap. 10 10.8 REACTOR SHIELD DESIGN: REMOVAL-A TTENUATION CALCULATIONS The prelimina ry design of a reactor shield can be carried out using the point kernel and the removal cross-sections discussed in the preceding section. Such point ker­ nel removal-attenuation calculations are best perfonned on a computer, and meth­ ods for doing so are discucssed at the end of this section. However, it is shown first how the gross properties of a reactor shield can be calculated analytically using the simple exponential kernel given in Eq. (10.64). Consider a spherical reactor consisting of a core of radius R surrounded by a hydrogenous shield of thickness a as shown in Fig. 10.20. The core consists of a mixture of metal and water, with the volume fraction of metal equal to f It is assumed for simplicity that the fission neutrons are being produced unifonnly throughout the coefficient at the rate of S neutrons/cm 3 -sec. The fast neutron flux at the point P at the surface of the shield can be com­ puted by adding up the contributions to the flux from volume elements d V within the core. In view of the symmetry of the problem, the appropriate volume element is that of a ring (see Fig. 10.20) whose volume is dV = 2rrr2 sin e de dr. Since the removal cross-section is equivalent to an absorption cross-section, the flux at P from the element dV is given by d¢(P) = SA dV e-n(r), 4rrr2 (10.68) where n (r) is the total number of removal mean free paths from d V to P In the core water, there are dV Core r � a \ p () Figure 10.20 Spherical reactor core surrounded by a spherical shield.

The metal in the core accounts for another mean free paths, where L. RM is the macroscopic removal cross-section of the metal at its normal density. Finally, the number of mean free paths in the shield is where L.Rs is the removal cross-section of the shield.

'Y wlthlron - 'Y nOlron· (10.75) The core of a certain research reactor, operating at a power of 250 kilowatts, consists of an assembly of uranium rods and water, with a metal volume fraction of 0.75. The core has a volume of 32 liters and is surrounded by a water reflector 15 cm thick. It is proposed to shield this reactor by 150 cm of unit-density water. Estimate the fast neutron dose rate at the surface of this shield. Solution. With a recoverable energy per fission of 200 meV = 3.2 x 10-11 joule, there are 250,000 joules/sec -:-3.2 x 10-11 joules/fission = 7.81 x 1015 fissions/sec in the core. This gives a fission density of 7.81 x 1015/32 X 103 = 2.44 X 1011 fissions/cm3-sec. Assuming that the fissions occur in 235U, then v = 2.42 and S = 2.42 x 2.44 x 1011 = 5.90 X 1011 neutrons/cm 3-sec. The radius of the core, which is taken to be spherical, is 3 3 x 32,000 R = = 19. 7 � 20 cm. 41r Since the reflector and shield are both water, the effective thickness of the shield is a = 165 cm. From Table 10.4, the macroscopic removal cross-section of uranium is 0.174 cm-1 Then from Eq. (10.69), a = 0.25 x 0.103 + 0.75 x 0.174 = 0.156 cm-, 2aR = 2 x 0.156 x 20 = 6.24,

[Ans.] 6.8 The reactor would need additional shielding, at least as far as the neutrons are con­ cerned, if access to the region near the surface of the shield was pennitted. 10.9 THE REMOVAL-D IFFUSION METHOD The removal-atten uation method discussed in the last section takes into account the most energetic neutrons. The complete design of a shield usually also requires a knowledge of the spatial distributions of neutrons of all energies, including ther­ mal neutrons, which detemine the sources of inelastic and capture y-rays. These distributions are provided by the removal-diffusion method,11 which is a combina­ tion of a removal-atte nuation calculation and a multi group calculation of the type given in Section 6.7. Several versions of the removal-diff usion method have been developed over the years. In most of these, the neutrons in a shield are divided into three broad classes. The first class consists of the fast neutrons-those with energies exceeding 6 MeV. It is these neutrons that penetrate deepest into the shield. Lumped together, these are called the removal group neutrons. The neutrons in the second class are those that have been knocked out of the removal group by collisions in the shield, together with the neutrons that have leaked from the core. Neutrons in this class undergo diffusion and slowing down as the result of successive collisions, just like the neutrons in the reactor. These are called intermediate neutrons. The third class is composed of those neutrons that have thennalized and diffuse about as thennal neutrons. In a removal-diff usion calculation, the removal group neutrons are divided into N groups and the intennediate neutrons are divided into M groups; there is 11 This is also called the Spinney method.

Consider now an arbitrary gth intermedia te group. As in Section 6.7, neutrons are lost from this group as the result of absorption or scattering to a lower group while neutrons enter the group from collisions occurring in the higher intermediate groups and in the removal groups. Let Sr-+g be the number of neutrons entering the gth group from the hth removal group. Then using the multigroup notation of Section 6.7, the diffusion equation for the gth group is Dg V2¢g - L.ag¢g -L L.g-+g'¢g + L L.g'-+g¢g + L N Sh-+g = o. (10.76) g'>g g' <g h=l The second term in this equation gives the true absorption of neutrons in the gth group; the third term gives the total number of neutrons scattered out of this group; the fourth gives the neutrons scattered into the gth group as the result of collisions in intermediate groups at higher energy; and the last term is the source of neutrons scattered into the gth group from collisions of the primary neutrons in all of the removal groups. The equation for the thermal neutrons is (10.77) The last term in this equation is the number of neutrons entering the thermal group per cm3/sec. The quantities Sh-+g are computed in the following way. First, removal group transfer cross-sections, L.R ,h-+g' are defined. These are equal to the probability­ per-unit-path-Iength that a neutron in the hth removal group will have a collision in which its energy drops into the gth intermediate group.

Equation (10.78) merely states that Sh�g is equal to the uncollided flux of neutrons in the hth group at the point r multiplied by the cross-section L. R. h� g for a collision that drops the neutron into the gth group. As in any mUltigroup calculation, the actual computations must be carried out on a computer. These proceed roughly as follows. First, the quantities Sh�g are computed by evaluating the integral in Eq. (10.78). Next, the first of the inter­ mediate group equations, which involves only the single group flux ¢1, is solved numerically for ¢1. Then this value of ¢1 is introduced into the second group flux equation and is solved for ¢2. This procedure is repeated until all of the group fluxes, including the thennal flux, have been detennined. In this computation, it is the usual practice to start the calculations at the core-reflector interface, matching boundary conditions of continuity of flux and current with the results of multigroup calculations used to detennine the criticality and internal fluxes of the reactor. It is in this way that the leakage of intennediate and thennal neutrons from the core into the shield are taken into account. The removal-diff usion method has been used successfully for the design of many reactor shields. Variants of the method described here are widely used by shielding designers. 10.10 EXACT METHODS A number of methods have been developed to calculate the penetration of neutrons and y-rays through shields. These methods may be divided into two general cate­ gories. In the first of these, the transport equation, which describes the distribution

 text: Sec. 10.10 Exact Methods 591 of radiation within the shield, is solved by one of several numerical techniques. A discussion of such techniques is beyond the scope of this book, and the reader should consult the references at the end of the chapter. In any case, all of the meth­ ods based on solving the transport equation require the use of a computer, and many computer problems have been written to calculate the penetration of radiation as a function of shield configuration, composition, and thickness. The second type of attenuation calculation uses the Monte Carlo method, 12 which is alluded to in Chapter 9. The idea behind this method can be understood by the following analogy. Suppose it is desired to determine the probability of winning the card game solitaire ("patience" ). There are two approaches one can take. First, all of the probabilities of the various hands can be computed. Then, step by step, as the game is played, these probabilities are combined to give a final answer. This is a fairly involved computation. A far more simple and pleasant procedure is merely to playa few hands of the game and record the number of times the game is won. This number divided by the total number of games played is an estimate of the probabil­ ity of winning. Naturally, the more hands that are played, the better this estimate is. In much the same way, a Monte Carlo calculation of the penetration of radi­ ation proceeds by compiling the life histories of individual neutrons (or y-rays) as they move about-from the point where they enter the shield to the point where they are either absorbed in the shield or pass through it. The number of neu­ trons that successfully penetrate the shield divided by the total number of histo­ ries is then an estimate of the probability that a neutron will not be stopped by the shield. To be specific, consider a Monte Carlo calculation of the attenuation of a par­ allel beam of monenergetic neutrons with energy Eo by a slab shield of thickness a. To start the history of the first neutron, it is necessary to determine where, if at all, the neutron has its first collision. This is done by sampling the first collision probability distribution function (see Section 3.3) p(x) = 1:te-E/x where 1:t is evaluated at the energy Eo. Methods are available for sampling such a distribution function in a random manner. Suppose that the value of x selected is Xl. It is next necessary to test whether Xl is greater than or less than a. If Xl > a, then the neutron has penetrated the shield without a collision ; this fact is registered, and the history is terminated. However, if Xl < a, a collision has occurred within the shield at the point Xl. The type of collision must now be determined. If it is assumed that only absorption and elastic scattering are possible, their probabilities of occurrences are Pa = 1:a / 1:t for absorption and Ps = 1:s /1:, for scattering, where all cross­ sections are computed at the energy Eo and, of course, Pa + Ps = 1. The nature of 12 Monte Carlo was the code name given to this method during World War II.

 text: 592 Radiation Shielding Chap. 10 the collision is obtained by comparing Pa with a number R selected from a group of random numbers having values between 0 and 1. Then if R < Pa, the collision is assumed to be an absorption. If R > Pa, it is taken to be elastic scattering. The rationale behind this procedure is that the random numbers R lie unifonnly between 0 and 1 so that the fraction of the in­ teractions chosen to be absorption reactions will necessarily be equal to Pa, as required. If the collision results in absorption, then the history is tenninated and another started. If it is an elastic collision, then the angle at which the neutron is scattered must be detennined by randomly sampling the experimental angular distribution of scattering. Suppose that this yields the angle U1• Then the energy of the scattered neutron can be computed from Eq. (3.28): El = Eo 2 [cos U1 + J A2 -sin2 U1] , (A + 1) where A is the mass number of the struck nucleus. The history of this neutron is now continued by again sampling the collision distribution function p(x) to de­ tennine where the neutron has its second collision, taking note of the fact that the neutron started from the point Xl and moved in the direction U1• Again a test is made as to whether this collision occurs inside the shield. If it does, the nature of the collision is again detennined, and so on. When this computation is programmed for a computer, each of the previous steps is a subroutine, which is used repeatedly as the calculation proceeds. A set of Monte Carlo computations of particular interest is that of Clark, et al.13 These authors calculated the attenuation of beams of neutrons nonnally inci­ dent on slabs of ordinary concrete for several neutron energies. Sample results of these calculations are shown in Fig. 10.23(a) and (b), where the dose equivalent rate14 per unit incident beam intensity is given as a function of the slab thick­ ness for two-beam energies. Curves like these are useful in designing shields for accelerator-produced neutrons and for other sources of neutrons with known en­ ergy spectra. 13Clark, F. H., N. A. Betz, and J.

The curves in Fig. 10.23 are based on a quality factor of 10.

 text: Sec. 10.11 Shielding y-Rays 595 10.11 SHIELDING ,-RAYS Up to this point, the reactor shield has been designed to attenuate only the neu­ trons, and it is necessary next to consider the y-rays. A method for calculating the penetration of y -rays from a given distribution of y -ray sources and detennining the shielding necessary to reduce the y-ray flux to desired levels was discussed in the first part of this chapter. It is recalled that for a general source distribution this involves the evaluation of the integral in Eq. (10.57), which is best done with a high-speed computer. The problem of shielding reactor y-rays thus reduces to that of finding the space and energy distribution of these y-rays. Most of the y-rays emanating from a reactor-the prompt fission y-rays, the fission product decay y-rays, and those from radiative capture and inelastic scattering-appear with more or less continuous energy spectra. For attenuation calculations these spectra are divided into energy groups, and the computations are carried out, group by group, by lumping together all of the y-rays emitted in each group and by assuming that these y -rays all have a single, average energy of the group. Consider first the prompt fission y-rays. Their spectrum rises sharply from very low values to a peak at 0.3 MeV and then diminishes slowly according to the distribution function Xp(E) = 26.0e-2.3E = 8.0e-l.lE, 0.3 < E < 1, 1 < E < 7, where E is in MeV. The function Xp(E) is defined so that Xp(E) dE is the number of prompt y-rays emitted per fission with energies between E and E + dE. To determine the number of y-rays, Xpn, emitted in the nth group, lying between the energies En and En+h the total energy emitted by these y-rays is divided by the average energy of the group En = (En + En+d/2. Thus, 1 lEn+1 Xpn = -=- EXp(E)dE. En En (10.79) Table 10.5 gives values of Xpn obtained in this way.I5 The source density at the point r of prompt y-rays in the nth group is then given by Sn (r) = XpnS(r), where S(r) is the number of fissions occurring per cm3/sec at the point r. 15Equation (10.79) is an energy-weighted average. It is appropriate to use such an average because the later computation of the exposure rate from these y-rays involves an integration of the y-ray flux times the y-ray energy, as shown by Eq. (10.5).

 text: 596 Radiation Shielding Chap. 10 TABLE 10.5 NUMB ERS OF PROMPT FISSION y-RAYS AND FISSION PRODUC T DECAY y-RAYS EMITTED PER FISSION Energy Group interval, Prompt Decay number MeV (Xpn) (Xdn) Total 0-1 5.2 3.2 8.4 2 1-3 1.8 1.5 3.3 3 3-5 0.22 0.18 0.40 4 5-7 0.025 0.021 0.046 The spectrum of the fission product decay y-rays changes with time from the instant the fission products are formed. In general, the more energetic y -rays are emitted more rapidly than those with lower energy so that the spectrum tends to soften as time passes. In an operating reactor, however, where new fission products are continually being formed, the fission product y-ray spectrum comes more or less to equilibrium. This is approximately the same as the prompt fission spectrum-namely, (10.80) y-rays per fission per MeV. The average numbers of y-rays Xdn emitted in the various energy groups are also given in Table 10.5. The total source of prompt fission y-rays and fission product decay y-rays is then (10.81) The spectra of capture y-rays, which are produced primarily by the radiative capture of thermal neutrons, depend on the capturing nucleus. Table 10.6 gives these spectra for a few of the nuclei found in many reactors. More complete tabula­ tions are given in the references at the end of the chapter. If the number of photons emitted in the nth group by neutron capture in the mth nucleus is denoted by XTmn, then the source density of capture y -rays at the point r is Sn(r) = L XTmnI:ym(r)¢T(r), (10.82) m where I:ym (r) is the macroscopic thermal capture cross-section for the mth element at rand ¢T (r) is the thermal flux. The situation with inelastic y-rays is somewhat more complica ted than with capture y-rays because the spectrum depends not only on the atom from which the neutron is scattered, but also on the energy of the incident neutron. Let Ximnh be the number of y-rays emitted with the energy of the nth group as the result of

Extensive tables of Ximnh are available and are not reproduced here. The source density of inelastic y-rays in the nth group is then Sn(r) = LXimnh�imh(r)¢h(r). mh (l0.83) Here �imh (r) is the macroscopic inelastic cross-section for the mth atom for the hth group of a removal-diff usion calculation, and ¢h (r) is the hth group flux. With the y-ray source distributions known, the exposure rate outside the shield can be detennined from Eq. (l0.57) as described earlier. If it is found that the exposure level is unacceptable, then more shielding must be added beyond that required for the neutrons alone, or a change in the composition of the shield may be indicated. For instance, if it turns out that the exposure rate from capture y-rays ema­ nating from the shield is too high, it may be necessary to add boron to the shield or add a thickness of y-ray shielding to the outside of the shield. The importance of such y -rays is illustrated in Fig. 10.24. This figure shows the ratio of the dose rate from y-rays produced in slabs of concrete to the dose rate from neutrons that have penetrated the slabs-for various slab thicknesses and as a function of the en­ ergy of the incident neutrons. It is observed that, with an incident beam of 4-MeV neutrons, the y-ray and neutron dose rates are about equal for a 100-cm slab. With boron added to the concrete, the ratios shown in the figure would be substantially smaller. In any event, once changes in the shield design have been made, new neutron calculations must be carried out to determine new multigroup neutron fluxes. The y-ray calculations are then repeated, new adjustments to the shield are made, and

This procedure is continued until the most appropriate shield is obtained, providing the desired attenuation for both neutrons and y -rays. Example 10.8 A teaching reactor consists of a hydrogenous core surrounded by a water reflector and water shield. The distance from the center of the core to the surface of the shield is 7 ft. By treating the core as a point source, estimate the exposure rate from the prompt fission y-rays at the surface of the shield when the reactor is operating at a power of 10 watts. Solution. It is first necessary to determine the rate at which fissions are occurring in the core. Assuming a recoverable energy per fission of 200 MeV = 3.2 x 10-11 joules, this is fission rate = 10 joules/sec 7 3.2 x 10-11joules/fissions = 3.13 x 1011 fissions/sec.

 text: Sec. 10.12 Coolant Activa tion 599 The y-rays in the first group in Table 10.5 make a negligible contribution to the exposure rate, so consider those in the second group. There are S = 1.8 x 3.13 x 1011 = 5.63 X lOll y-rays/sec emitted in this group, all of which are assumed to have an energy of 2 Me V. The buildup flux at the shield surface from these y-rays is then S ¢b = 4rr R2 Bp(f.LR)e-Il- R Here R = 7 ft = 7 x 12 x 2.54 = 213 cm. From Table 11.4, f.L = 0.0493 cm-l so that f.LR = 10.5. Then from Table 10.2, Bp = 13.1 and 5.63 x lOll ¢b = 2 x 13.1 x e-1O.5 = 356y-rays/cm2-sec. 4rr(213) From Fig. 9.9, this gives an exposure rate of 1.1 mRlhr. [Ans.] The y-rays in other groups give the following exposures: first group, 0.0013 mRlhr; third group, 2.3mR1hr; and fourth group, 0.93 mRlhr. The total exposure rate is 4.3 mRIhr. [Ans.] 10.12 COOLANT ACTIVATION Radioactivity in the coolant is an important source of radiation external to a reac­ tor. This radioactivity originates in several ways: (a) by neutron activation of the coolant; (b) by activation of impurity atoms contained in the coolant; and (c) by picking up the coolant of radioactive atoms from the walls of the coolant channels in the reactor. The most important reactions by which coolants are activated are listed in Table 10.7. All of the nuclides formed in these reactions undergo f3 - decay, and the radiation listed in the table is emitted immediately owing the emission of the TABLE 10.7 ACTIVATION REACTI ONS IN COOLANTS Cross-section, Reaction b Half-life 16O(n,p)16N 1.9 x 10-5* 7.1 s 17O(n,p)17N 5.2 x 10-6* 4.14 s 18O(n,y)180 2.1 x 1O-4t 29 s 23Na(n,y)24Na 0.53t 15.0 h 40 Ar(n,y )41 Ar 0.53t 1.83 h * Average cross-section over fission spectrum; see text. tThermal (0.0253 eV) cross-section.

 text: 600 Radiation Shielding Chap. 10 fJ-rays. The energies of the fJ-rays are not included in the table since these ordinar­ ily do not present a radiation hazard except in the case of an accident. The first three reactions in the table are responsible for the radioactivity of the water in water-cooled reactors. Of these, the 160(n,p)16N reaction is the most important despite that it is an endothermic reaction with a threshold energy of 10.2 MeV. The 170(n,p)17N reaction is also endother mic; it has a threshold of 8.5 MeV. It should be noted that this peculiar reaction leads to the emission of neutrons. This occurs because 95% of the ,B-decays of the l7N go to the excited states of l7 0 having energies greater than the binding energy of the last neutron in this nucleus. Since l70 consists of a tightly bound core of 160 and a loosely attached neutron, this neutron is immediately emitted when it has sufficient energy to do so. The lSO(n,y)190 reaction is exothermic and occurs at all energies, including thermal energies. However, it is a less important source of y-rays than the 160(n,p)16N reaction because the isotopic abundance of ISO is so low (0.204 a/o) compared to that of 160 (99.8 a/o), and because the y-rays are less energetic. The activation of sodium coolants is due entirely to the 23Na(n,y)24Na re­ action as sodium consists only of the single isotope 23Na. This reaction occurs with neutrons of all energies. The 2.75 MeV and l.37 MeV y-rays are emitted in cascade-that is, both appear with each disintegration of 24Na. When air is used as a reactor coolant, it becomes radioactive as the result of the activation of argon, which is present to the extent of 1.3 W /0 in air. Reactions with oxygen and nitrogen do not contribute significantly to the activation of air. Argon is also present in small amounts in CO2, which is used to cool many of the British reactors, and its activation accounts for the radioactivity of the CO2 coolant. Argon activation is also a problem in teaching and research reactors of the swimming pool type, in which the reactor is located at the bottom of an open tank of water. A certain amount of air containing argon becomes dissolved in the pool water; on passing through the core, the argon becomes activated. Later this radioactive argon emerges from the pool surface and passes into the atmosphere above the reactor. The activity acquired by a coolant via the prior reactions depends on the flow pattern of the coolant and its residence times within and without a neutron flux. Figure 10.25 shows the simplest type of coolant flow, the coolant spending, the time ti in the reactor flux, and to in the outer circuit with no flux. Consider a unit volume of coolant leaving the reactor. If its activity at this point is a, then at the time to later, when it reenters the reactor, its activity will have fallen to where A is the decay constant. In passing through the reactor, the already activated atoms continue to decay by the amount

In the reactor, however, a unit volume, exposed to an average flux ¢av, acquires in the time tj the additional activity �act¢av(1 -e-Ati), where �act is the average macroscopic activation cross-section in the flux ¢av. The total activity leaving the reactor is thus ae-)..(ti+to) + �act¢av(1 -e-Ati). In equilibrium, after the coolant has made many passes around the circuit, this activity must be equal to a-that is, Solving for a gives a= � act¢av (1 -e -Ati ) I -e-)..(ti+to) (10.84) This is the activity of the coolant leaving the reactor-the point where the activity is the highest. If the residence times tj and to are small compared with the half­ life of the induced activity, as is the case with sodium-cooled reactors, then the exponentials in Eq. (10.84) can be expanded with the result tj a = �act¢av--. tj + to (10.85) The quantity �act¢av, the activation rate per unit volume in the reactor, must be chosen appropriately for the activation reaction in question. Thus, for the 180 (n,y) 190 and 40 Ar(n,y )41 Ar reactions, �act is the macroscopic thermal activation cross-section and ¢av is the space-averaged thermal flux. For the threshold reactions in oxygen, the activation rate is given by the integral

The function <Pav(E) can be estimated by assuming that any col­ lision, except small-angle scattering, drops the energy of a fission neutron below threshold. Then in the steady state, the number of neutrons scattered out of the energy interval dE at E is equal to the number produced in dE-that is, LR(E)<Pav(E) dE = SeE) dE, where LR(E) is the removal cross-section at the energy E, and SeE) is the number of fission neutrons produced per unit energy at E, which is assumed to be indepen­ dent of position in the reactor. Solving for <Pav(E) gives SeE) <Pav(E) = LR(E)· Introducing this function into Eq.

The application of these formulas is illustrated by the following example. Example 10.9 A hypothetical water-moderated and water-cooled reactor operates at a power density of 55 watts/cm3 The core consists of uranium rods and water; the metal volume fraction of the rods is 0.33. The water spends an average of 3 sec in the reactor and 2 sec in the external coolant circuit. Estimate the equilibrium activity of the water leaving the reactor due to the 160(n,p)16N reaction. Solution. The atom density of oxygen in water at normal density is 0.033 x 1024 per cm3, and virtually all of this is 160. In the present case, the effective density of the water is 0.67 g/cm3 so that (l:act) is (l:act) = 0.67 x 0.033 x 1.9 x 10-5 = 4.2 x 10-7cm-1 Assuming a recoverable energy of 200 MeV = 3.2 x 10-11 joules per fission, the fission density is 55/3.2 x 1-11 = 1.72 X 1012 fissions/cm3-sec, so that with 2.42 neutrons emitted per fission, S = 2.42 x 1.72 x 1012 = 4.2 X 1012 neutrons/cm 3-sec. From Table 10.4, bR for water is 0.103 cm-I and for uranium is 0.174 cm-I For the uranium-water mixture, therefore, bR = 0.67 x 0.103 + 0.33 x 0.174 = 0.126 cm- By use of Eq. (10.89), the activation rate is then found to be 4.2 x 10-7 x 4.2 X 1012 7 3 l:actQJav = 0.126 = 1.40 x 10 atoms/cm -sec. Introducing this result into Eq. (10.84), with tj = 3 sec, to = 2 sec, and)", = 0.693/71 = 0.0976 sec-I, gives 1.40" x 10\1 -e-3xO.0976) a= 1 -e-5xO.0976 = 9.20 x 106 disintegrations/cm 3-sec = 249tlCi/cm 3 [Ans.] Sodium is used mostly to cool fast reactors, and its activation is due to the absorption of fast and intermediate energy neutrons. Thus, the activation rate per cm3 is given by (10.90)

 text: 604 Radiation Shielding Chap. 10 where the integration is carried out over the entire neutron spectrum. In terms of the multigroup formula given in Section 6.7, this can be written as L.act<Pav = L L.act<Pav g , g (10.91) where L.actg is the macroscopic activation (radiative capture) cross-section of sodium for the gth group and <Pav g is the space-averaged flux in this group. The activation of coolant atoms discussed earlier is ordinarily the major source of radioactivity in reactor coolant loops while the reactor is in operation. It is far more important than the activation of impurities in the coolant or the ac­ quisition of radioactive atoms from the reactor by the coolant. However, when the reactor is shut down, the coolant activity quickly dies away except in the case of sodium (see Table 10.7), and the residual coolant activity is due to these extrane­ ous atoms. Furthermore, these atoms tend to deposit along the walls of the primary coolant piping and in valves, pumps, and heat exchangers . This gives rise to the radioactivity of these components even if the coolant is removed, which hampers maintenance and repairs. In any event, it is difficult to predict the level of this activity since it depends on countless numbers of materials present in the reactor and in the primary coolant system. 10.13 DUCTS IN SHIELDS Passages or ducts through a reactor shield are necessary to accommodate instru­ mentation cables and coolant channels, as well as to provide access for refueling and maintenance. Penetrations are normally also present in the shielded walls of the reactor room and in other compartments in a nuclear power plant, and in the walls of rooms containing accelerators or other sources of radiation. Any penetration of this type can be a serious source of radiation leakage through the shield. The worst possible situation is that of a straight duct containing air or some other gas. In this case, the radiation passes directly through the duct without attenuation-a process known as radiation streaming. To avoid streaming, ducts are designed with sharp bends where possible, as indicated in Fig. 10.26. In such Figure 10.26 A duct through a shield.

Nevertheless, it is sometimes necessary to provide passages directly through a shield, which is plugged while the reactor is in operation. This is the case, for instance, with refueling ports. The duct and plug are then made in a series of steps as shown in Fig. 10.27. This effectively reduces the streaming of radiation through the space between the plug and wall. The computation of the penetration of radiation through ducts with bends and/or steps is quite complica ted and is not discussed here. Nevertheless, the pres­ ence of ducts is an important consideration in the design of any shield. REFERE NCES General Chilton, A. B., Principles of Radiation Shielding. Paramus: Prentice-Hall, 1983.
