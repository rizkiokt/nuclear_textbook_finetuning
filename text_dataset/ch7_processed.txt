 text: 7 The Time-Dependent Reactor The previous Chapter was concerned with critical nuclear reactors operating at constant power. Needless to say, reactors are not always critical. It is necessary, for instance, for a reactor to be supercritical to start it up or raise its power level, whereas it must be subcritical to shut it down or reduce power. The study of the behavior of the neutron population in a noncritical reactor is called reactor kinetics. This subject is discussed in Section 7.2. The degree of criticality of a reactor is usually regulated by the use of control rods or chemical shim. Control rods are pieces or assemblies of neutron-absorbing material whose motions have an effect on the mUltiplication factor of the system. Thus, if a control rod is withdrawn from a critical reactor, the reactor tends to be­come supercritical; if a rod is inserted, the system falls subcritical. With chemical shim, control is accomplished by varying the concentration of a neutron-absorbing chemical, usually boric acid (H3B03), in a water moderator or coolant. Some el­ementary calculations of the effectiveness of control rods and chemical shim in reactor control are given in Section 7.3. One of the most important factors affecting criticality is the reactor temper­ature. Several of the parameters entering into the value of k are temperature de­pendent, and changes in T necessarily lead to changes in k. This circumstance is 327

 text: 328 The Time-Dependent Reactor Chap. 7 especially relevant to the question of reactor safety and is discussed in Section 7.4. A related matter, the effect on k of the formation of voids within a reactor, is also considered in Section 7.4. Besides changing reactor power level and responding to changes in temper­ ature, control rods and/or chemical shim systems are used to compensa te for the bumup of the fuel over the lifetime of a reactor core. In this connection, it should be noted that a reactor is initially fueled with more than the minimum amount of fuel necessary for criticality-if this were not the case and it were fueled with only its minimum critical mass, the reactor would fall subcritical after the first fission. Control rods, boric acid, gadolinium, and other neutron absorbers are introduced into the core to compensa te for the excess fuel. Then as fissions occur, the fuel is consumed, the gadolinium is depleted, and the rods are slowly withdrawn or the H3B03 concentration is reduced to keep the reactor critical. Two fission-product nuclides are formed with each fission, so there is an accu­ mulation of fission products as the fuel is consumed. Certain of these nuclides-in particular, 135Xe and 149Sm-have very large absorption cross-sections, and their presence in a reactor can have a profound effect on the value of k. Most of the other fission products have much smaller rra and tend to reduce k more gradually over the life of the core. The generation and accumula tion of fission-product poisons is discussed in Section 7.5. In reactors containing fertile material, the production by conversion of new fissile material compensates to some extent for fuel bumup and fission product formation. These changes in the properties of a reactor core with time have an obvious effect on determining the useful life of the total energy output which can be expected from a given core, and therefore have a bearing on overall power costs. This interplay between fuel properties and the economics of power production, together with the management decisions it makes necessary, form the subject of nuclear fuel management which concludes this chapter. 7.1 CLASSIFICATION OF TIME PROBLEMS The time dependence of the neutron population may be divided into three classes of problems. These classes are the short, intermediate, and long time problems. The first class of short time problems usually occurs over seconds to tens of minutes. In this class of problems, the depletion of the fuel is small and can b€ ignon�d. Such problems arise during reactor transient and safety analysis calculations. The second class of problems involves time scales that are on the order of hours to at most a day or two. Here again, the depletion of the fuel is ignored. However, the changing characteristics of the fission products must be accounted for.

 text: Sec. 7.1 Classification of Time Problems 329 Finally, the long-tenn problems involve time periods of days to months. This class of problems requires a detailed knowledge of the fuel depletion and the dis­tribution of both the flux and fuel in the reactor. This problem is of major concern for fuel-management calculations. Long Time or Dep letion Problems These problems are concerned with the variation of the neutron flux over long periods of time. However, they can be treated in a relatively simple manner by assuming that the changes in the flux occur slowly over time, and hence the reactor may be treated as if it is in a se­ries of stationary states. The problems are solved using an adiabatic approximation where the reactor is assumed to go through several stationary configurations. These configurations are detennined by solving the steady-state time-independent case. This type of problem is solved by assuming that the neutron production and loss tenns are balanced. The diffusion equation is written as (7.1) where A is an eigenvalue of the problem. It is assumed to be adjustable and is varied to give the solution. For a time-independent solution, A must be equal to 1. If A =1= I, then something must be changed, such as the buckling so that the leakage is changed, or the absorption or the fission cross-section so that the reaction rates are altered. The design problem is then to obtain an eigenvalue of A = 1 throughout the life of the reactor. Once the condition is obtained, the reactor power will be constant and time independent. The multiplication factor of the core will be equal to one. One can identify A as equal to 1/ k where k is the multiplication factor. The process in reality has introduced a parameter A that is equal to one when the problem is time independent. In doing the analysis in this manner, we have solved an artificial problem that corresponds to the case of k = 1. Values of A other than one are not real since the problem is then time dependent. But the value of A does give us an understanding of what state the reactor is in. The management of the fuel in a reactor is largely based on this type of an approach. Short Time Problems These problems are typically encountered when there is an action that causes the conditions in the reactor system to be perturbed. For example, the steam demand might suddenly be altered due to a change in tur­bine load. In a BWR, this is seen as a change in pressure in the reactor vessel. For a PWR, the change manifests itself as an alteration in the primary system tempera­ture. These changes lead to changes in the moderation rate of the neutrons, causing the mUltiplication factor, k, to change. The method most often used to solve short-tenn problems is based on the as­sumption that the shape of the reactor flux does not change. The reactor is assumed

page number: 348
 text: 330 The Time-Dependen t Reactor Chap. 7 to act as a point, hence the name point kinetics. Such an approach is the basis for most analyses of reactor systems except where flux shapes are known to vary with time. Intermediate lime Problems This class of problems is dominated by the changing concentration of the fission products due to their radioactive decay. Since several of the fission products are produced in significant quantities and have large enough thennal neutron absorption cross-sections, they become of concern due to their absorption of thennal neutrons. Since their concentrations are varying with time, the variation will affect the absorption tenn in the multiplication factor. This change in absorption rate must then be accounted for in the calculation if the reactor is to stay critical. Solution methods vary depending on the need to account for the spatial vari­ation of the fission products. If dependence of the concentration is ignored, then the point kinetics equation may be used to solve for the time-dependent power by properly accounting for the time variation of k. 7.2 REACTOR KINETICS It is recalled from Chapter 3 that most of the neutrons emitted in fission appear virtually at the instant of fission; these are the prompt neutrons. A small fraction of the fission neutrons appears long after the fission event; these fissions are delayed neutrons. The time behavior of a reactor depends on the various properties of these two types of neutrons. The prompt neutrons are considered first. Prompt Neutron Lifetime Following their emission, the prompt fission neutrons slow down as the result of elastic and inelastic collisions with nuclei in the system. In a fast reactor, they do not slow down very much-only to the order of tens or hundreds of ke V-before they are absorbed or leak out of the core. In thennal reactors, however, most of them succeed in reaching thennal energies without being absorbed or escaping from the system. As thennal neutrons, they diffuse about in the reactor; some eventually are absorbed and some leak out. The average time between the emission of the prompt neutrons and their absorption in a reactor is called the prompt neutron lifetime and is denoted by l p' Consider first the value of l p in an infinite thennal reactor. It ca,n be shown theoretically, and it has been found experimentally, that the time required for a neutron to slow down to thennal energies is small compared to the time that the neutron spends as a thennal neutron before it is finally absorbed. The average life­time of a thennal neutron in an infinite system is called the mean diffusion time and

A thermal neutron of energy E travels, on the average, an absorption mean free path Aa (E) before being absorbed. It survives, therefore, the time teE) = Aa(E)/v(E), (7.3) where veE) is the neutron speed corresponding to the energy E. The mean diffu­sion time is then the average value of t (E)-that is, td = teE). (7.4) Since Aa(E) l/La(E), where La(E) is the macroscopic absorption cross-section at the energy E, Eq. (7.3) can be written as 1 teE) = La(E)v(E). (7.5) If the absorption is 1/ v, as it is at least approximately in thermal reactors, La (E) = La(Eo)vo(E)/v(E), where Eo = 0.0253 eV and Vo = 2,200 m/sec, and Eq. (7.5) becomes 1 teE) = . La(EO)vO Thus, t (E) is a constant, independent of E, and 1 td= ---­La(Eo)vo (7.6) (7.7) where use has been made of Eqs. (5.55) and (5.59) with ga (T) = 1.

(7.7) becomes which can also be written as fi LaM td = --- -----2VTLaM LaF + LaM (7.8) The first factor in this equation is the mean diffusion time for the moderator, tdM; the second factor is equal to 1-f, where f is the thermal utilization (see Eq. 6.58). Thus, for the mixture, (7.9) Example 7.1 Calculate the prompt neutron lifetime in an infinite, critical thermal reactor consist­ ing of a homogeneous mixture of 235U and unit density H20 at room temperature. Solution. Since the reactor is critical, koo = rJT f = 1, so that f = l/rJT. From Table 6.3, rJT = 2.065 and therefore f = 0.484. According to Table 7.1, td for water is 2.1 x 10-4 sec. Using Eqs. (7.2) and (7.8), lp ::: td = 2.1 x 10-4(1 -0.484) = 1.08 x 10-4 sec. [Ans.] The prior results only pertain to thermal reactors. Prompt neutron lifetimes are considerably shorter in fast reactors than in thermal reactors since the neutrons never have an opportunity to reach thermal energies. In a fast reactor, the value of I p is on the order of 10-7 sec. Reactor with No Delayed Neutrons As noted at the beginning of this section, the delayed neutrons play an important role in reactor kinetics. This is a remarkable fact since so f€w fission n€utrons ar€ delayed-less than 1 % for thennal fissien in 235U. Te understand the impertance of the delayed neutrons, it is helpful to consider first the kinetics of a reactor in the absence of delayed neutrons-that is, assuming that all neutrons are emitted promptly in fission. For the moment, the discussion is restricted to the infinite ther­mal reactor.

 text: Sec. 7.2 Reactor Kinetics 333 Next we note that the absorption of a fission neutron in the fission process be­gins a new generation of fission neutrons. The mean generation time, A, is defined as the time between the birth of a neutron and subsequent absorption-inducing fis­sion. In the typical case of k ::: 1 and in the absence of delayed neutrons, lp is approximately equal to A-the time between successive generations of neutrons in the chain reaction. It follows from the definition of koo that the absorption of a neutron from one generation leads to the absorption, l p sec later, of koo neutrons in the next generation. Thus, if N F(t) is the number of fissions (which, of course, is proportional to the number of neutron absorptions) occurring per cm3/sec at the time t, then the fission rate l p seconds later will be (7.10) The first tenn in this equation can be expanded as and when this is substituted back into Eq. (7.10), the result is (7.11) The solution to this equation is (7.12) where N F(O) is the fission rate at t = O. Equation (7.12) can also be written as (7.13) in which lp T = ---'---koo -1 (7.14) is called the reactor period-in the absence of delayed neutrons. Example 7.2 Suppose that the reactor described in Example 7.1 is critical up to time t = 0, and then koo is increased from 1.000 to 1.001. Compute the response of the reactor to this change in koo.

page number: 352
 text: 334 The Time-Dependent Reactor Chap. 7 Solution. From Example 7.1, lp is approximately 10-4 sec, so that from Eq. (7.14), 10-4 T = ----- = 0.1 sec. 1.001 -l.000 The flux (and power) would therefore increase as elOt, where t is in seconds. [Ans.] The period computed in Example 7.2 is very short. Thus with a period of 0.1 sec, the reactor would pass through 10 periods in only 1 second, and the fission rate (and power) would increase by a factor of elO = 22,000. Had the reactor originally been operating at a power of 1 megawatt, the system would reach a power of 22,000 megawatts in 1 sec if it did not destroy itself first-as it undoubtedly would. Fortunately, this analysis, in which delayed neutrons have been omitted, does not describe the kinetics of an actual reactor. As is shown presently, the delayed neutrons considerably increase the reactor period. As a consequence, reactors can be controlled rather easily. Reactor with Delayed Neutrons In an accurate reactor kinetics calculation, it is necessary to consider in detail the production and decay of each of the six groups of delayed neutron precursors. The resulting mathematical analysis is necessarily rather complicated. To simplify the discussion, it is assumed for the moment that there is only one group of delayed neutrons that appear from the decay of a single hypothetical precursor. 1 Consider an infinite homogeneous thermal reactor that mayor may not be critical. Since the thermal flux must be independent of position, the time-dependent diffusion equation for the thermal neutrons is (see Eq. [5.16]): -dn ST -ba¢T = -, dt (7.15) where ST is the source density of neutrons slowing down into the thermal energy region, and n is the density of thermal neutrons. From Eq. (5.56), and Eq. (7.15) becomes 2 ¢T = y'nnvT, -y'n d¢T ST -La¢T = ---. 2VT dt (7.16) 1 The one delayed neutron group may be thought of as an effective delayed neutron group when an average over all six groups is taken.

(7.17) can also be written as sT depT =--epT=l -. �a P dt 335 (7.17) (7.18) If all of the fission neutrons were prompt, then, in view of the definition of koo, the source density would be (see Eq. [6.11]): However, the fraction fJ of the fission neutrons is delayed, and so only the fraction (l -fJ) is prompt. The contribution to ST due to the prompt neutrons is then ST (from prompt neutrons) = (l -fJ)k:xJ�aepT' A delayed neutron slows down very rapidly after it is emitted by its precur­sor. It follows that the contribution to the thermal source density from the delayed neutrons is equal to the rate of decay of the precursor multiplied by the probability p that the delayed neutron escapes resonance capture while slowing down. Thus, ST (from delayed neutrons) = PAC, where P is the resonance escape probability, A is the decay constant of the precur­sor, and C is the precursor concentration in atoms/cm3 Combining the prior results gives (7.19) Introducing this expression into Eq. (7.18) yields the following equation for the thermal flux: (7.20) The equation determining the precursor concentration can be obtained from the following argument. In Section 6.5, it was shown that the rate at which fission neutrons, prompt and delayed, are produced is 1JTEf�aepT / p. The rate at which de­layed neutrons are produced is then f3koo �aepT / p. Now since each delayed neutron appears as a result of the decay of a precursor, it follows that the rate of production of the precursor is also equal to f3koo �aepT / p.

Consider now a specific problem. Suppose that, up to the time t = 0, the reactor is critical and koo = 1. A step change is then made in koo so that the reac­tor becomes either supercritical or subcritical. It is required to determine ¢T as a function of time after t = O. This problem can be solved by assuming solutions of the form (7.22) and (7.23) where A and Co are constants and w is a parameter to be determined. Inserting these functions into Eq. (7.21) gives {3koo L-aA Co = . p(w + 'A) When Co and Eqs. (7.22) and (7.23) are introduced into Eq.

 text: Sec. 7.2 Reactor Kinetics In terms of the reactivity, Eq. (7.24) may be written as wip W � p= +---1 + wi p 1 + wi p W + A 337 (7.27) This result is known as the reactivity equation for one group of delayed neutrons. Before considering the significance of the reactivity equation, it should be noted that if a reactor is supercritical, then k > 1 and p is positive. In this situ­ation, the reactor is said to have positive reactivity. However, when the reactor is subcritical, k < 1, p is negative, and the reactor is said to have negative reactiv­ ity. It should be noted that, from Eq. (7.26), p is restricted to values in the range -00 < p < 1. Example 7.3 What is the reactivity corresponding to a change in k,:x; from 1.000 to 1.001 ? Solution. From Eq. (7.26) p = 1.001 -1 � 10-3 1.001 Since the numerator is equal to the change in k, p is equal to the fractional change in k. In this case, p is often expressed in percent-s pecifically, p = 100 X 10-3 = 0.1 percent. [Ans.] The reactivity equation, Eq. (7.27), gives a relationship between the reactivity of a reactor and those values of W for which the functions given in Eqs. (7.22) and (7.23) are solutions to the differential equations, Eqs. (7.20) and (7.21). In short, the problem of solving the differential equations has been reduced to the problem of finding the roots of Eq. (7.27) for a specified value of p. This can most conveniently be done by plotting the right-hand side (RHS) of the equation as a function of w as shown in Fig. 7.1. As indicated in the figure, this consists of three distinct branches. The roots of the equation are then located at the intersections, where these curves cross the horizontal lines corresponding to given values of p, the other for negative p. It is seen that there are two roots-wI and w2-for either + p and -p. Thus, it follows that the flux behaves as (7.28) where A I and A2 are constants. It is observed from Fig. 7.1 that when p is positive, WI is positive and W2 is negative. Thus, as time goes on, the second term in Eq. (7.28) dies out and the flux ultimately increases as eWJ t In contrast, when p is negative, both WI and W2 are negative, but W2 is more negative than WI. Thus, the second term in Eq. (7.28)

Values of the period for a 235U-fueled reactor computed from Eq. (7.32) are shown in Fig. 7.2 as a function of reactivity. Example 7.4 Using Fig. 7.2, detennine the period of the reactor described in Example 7.1 follow­ ing the change in koo from 1.000 to 1.001 (the same as given in Example 7.2). Solution. It was shown in Example 7.1 that I p 10-4 sec. In Example 7.3, the reactivity equivalent to this change in koo was computed to be p = 10-3 Thus, the reactor period, which may be read directly from Fig. 7.2, is 57 sec. [Ans.] The remarkable effect of the delayed neutrons on the time behavior of a reac­tor is evident by comparing the results of Examples 7.2 and 7.4. In the first example, the delayed neutrons were not taken into account in the calculation, and the period was only 0.1 sec. With the delayed neutrons included, the period was increased to 57 secs-a factor of over 500. To tum now to the kinetics of a fast reactor, it is recalled that the prompt neutron lifetime in this type of reactor is very short-on the order of 10-7 sec. Therefore, except for very large insertions of reactivity resulting in large values of W (short reactor periods), the quantity of wlp in Eq. (7.32) can be neglected. The reactivity equation for fast reactors is then approximately 6 �. p=WL: _l_. i=l W+Ai (7.33) For 235U-fueled fast reactors, the period can be read from the lp = 0 curve in Fig. 7.2. The Prompt Critical State It is shown in Section 6.1 that the multiplication factor is proportional to the total number of neutrons, prompt and delayed, emitted per fission. However, since only the fraction 0 -(3) of the fission neutrons are prompt, the mUltiplication factor as far as the prompt neutrons are concerned is actually 0 -(3)k. Therefore, when (7.34) the reactor is critical on prompt neutrons alone, the reactor is said to be prompt critical. In this case, the period is very short, as it is in Example 7.2. The reactivity corresponding to the prompt critical condition can be found by inserting k = I/O -�) from Eq. (7.34) into Eq. (7.26). It is easy to see that this gives

 text: Sec. 7.2 Reactor Kinetics 341 p={3 (7.35) as the condition for prompt criticality. Thus, since {3 = 0.0065 for fissions induced by thermal neutrons in 235U, a 235U-fueled thermal reactor becomes prompt critical with the addition of only about 0.0065, or .65% in reactivity. Because reactors have such short periods when they are prompt critical, it is normal practice to restrict (positive) reactivity additions to less than {3. There are some research reactors, such as the TRIGA reactor produced by General Atomics, with intrinsic properties that cause them to shut down rapidly when they become supercritical. When these reactors are suddenly made prompt critical, they deliver a sharp pulse of neutrons. The Pennsylvania State University's Breazeale Reactor, for example, may be pulsed to a power several thousand times that of its maximum steady-state value. Figure 7.3 shows a power pulse from this reactor. The pulse is generated by ejecting a control rod from the reactor, which increases the reactivity by 2.72{3. The amount of reactivity necessary to make a reactor prompt critical­namely, p = fJ-is used to define a unit of reactivity known as the dollar. Since the value of {3 varies from fuel to fuel, the dollar is not an absolute unit. Values of the delayed neutron fractions for the most important fissile and fertile isotopes are given in Table 7.2. For example, a dollar is worth 0.0065 in reactivity for a 235U-fueled reactor, but it is worth only {3 = 0.0026 for a 233U-fueled reactor. The reactivity equivalent to one one-hundredth of a dollar is called a cent. Example 7.5 The reactivity of the reactor in Example 7.3 is 0.001. If the reactor is fueled with 235U, what is its reactivity in dollars? Solution. The value of f3 is 0.0065. Thus, p is 0.001 p = -- = 0.154 dollars 0.0065 = 15.4 cents. [Ans.] The Prompt Jump (Drop) Following a sudden change in multiplication factor, a previously critical reactor exhibits a behavior given by Eq. (7.28)-namely, in the one delayed-group model and by a sum of seven exponentials in the more realistic case of six delayed groups,

Exact calculations show that, in the case of the one delayed-group model, A2 is negative for positive p and positive for negative p. The effect of the rapid die away of a negative tenn is to give a sudden rise in ¢ following the insertion of positive reactivity as shown in Fig. 7.4. Likewise, the die away of a positive tenn gives a sudden drop in ¢ for negative reactivity. To detennine the overall time behavior of a reactor, it is necessary to know the level to which the flux first rises or drops before assuming a stable period. The exact computations of the early response to changes in reactivity are rather complicated, especially when all seven tenns of the flux are included. A simple, approximate result can be obtained, however, by merely assuming that the concentrations of the delayed neutron precursors do not change over the time of the sudden rise or drop in flux.

 text: 344 The lime-Dependent Reactor Chap. 7 In the discussion that follows, we consider two situations. The first is when koo is initially equal to unity, and the second is when k i= 1. koo Equal to One In the first case, the precursor concentration is taken to be constant at its value in the critical reactor. Then from Eq. (7.21), de /dt = O. thus (7.36) where koo is placed equal to unity since the (infinite) reactor is originally critical. Also in Eq. (7.36), ¢TO is the flux prior to the change in reactivity. Introducing Eq. (7.36) into Eq. (7.20) gives d¢T lp-= [(1 -f3)koo -1]¢T + f3¢TO, dt where koo is the multiplication factor after the change in reactivity. The solution to this equation subject to the condition ¢T (0) = ¢TO is easily found to be [(1 -f3)koo -l]t f3¢TO [ [(1 -fJ)koo -1 ]t ] ¢T = ¢TO exp I p + 1 _ (1 _ f3)koo 1 -exp I p (7.37) Now for (1 -f3)koo < 1, that is, for reactivity less than prompt critical, the two exponentials in Eq. (7.37) die out with a period lp lp T= _, (1 -f3)koo -1 koo -1 which is the very short period given by Eq. (7.14) in the absence of delayed neu­trons. Thus, from Eq. (7.37), it is seen that ¢T quickly assumes the value fJ ¢T = 1 -(1 _ fJ)koo ¢TO. On introducing koo = 1/(1 - p) from Eq. (7.25), Eq. (7.38) becomes finally f3(1 -p) ¢T = p. ¢TO. p-p (7.38) (7.39) As a first application of Eq. (7.39), consider the case of a positive reactivity change, such as might be required to increase the power level of a reactor. For reasons of safety, such reactivity insertions are not usually so large as to cause a very short reactor period. Normally, power is raised at a period no less than about 2 minutes. From Fig. 7.2, this corresponds to a reactivity of p ::::: 0.0006 for a

 text: Sec. 7.2 Reactor Kinetics 345 • 235U-fueled reactor. When this value of p is introduced into Eq. (7.39), it is seen that ¢T � ¢TO. It follows that for positive reactivity insertions, the prompt jump in the flux is usually negligible, and the flux can be assumed to increase from its initial value on a stable exponential with a constant period. With negative reactivity, the situation is different, for now very large (nega­tive) reactivities can be introduced. Thus, when a reactor is scrammed, several or all of the control rods may be quickly inserted into the system. Suppose, for in­stance, that 20% in negative reactivity is suddenly inserted in a reactor fueled with 235U. Then substituting fJ = 0.0065 and p = -0.2 into Eq. (7.39) gives ¢T = 0.038¢TO· Thus, the reactor flux (and the power since this is proportional to the flux) drops quickly to about 4% of its initial value before the reactor goes on its stable period.2 Incidentally, in the one delayed-group approximation, it should be observed in Fig. 7.1 that, as p becomes increasingly negative, the first root of the reactivity equation approaches the value -A, the decay constant for a hypothetical one-group of delayed neutrons. When the reactivity equation for the actual case of six delayed neutron groups is plotted, the value of WI approaches A I, the decay constant for the longest lived precursor-namely, the precursor with a mean life of about 80 sec. Thus, with large negative reactivity insertions, the (negative) period has the value 1 1 T = -= -= 80 sec. WI Al This result is seen from Fig. 7.2. As shown in the figure a reactor goes on this 80-sec period with negative reactivity in excess of about .4%. Example 7.6 A 235U-fueled reactor operating at a constant power of 500 MW is scrammed by the sudden insertion of control rods worth 10% in reactivity. To what (fission) power level has the reactor fallen 10 minutes later? Solution. The power drops suddenly to the level PI, where ,8(1 -p) PI = Po ,8-p = 0.0065(1 + 0.10) x 500 = 33.5 MW 0.0065 + 0.10 2This result and the preceding discussion only pertain to the power produced as the result of fission within the reactor. Power produced by the decay of radioactive fission products is not included. It is shown in Chapter 8 that fission product decay power amounts to about 7% of the reactor power when the reactor has been operated long enough for the fission products to reach equilibrium levels. If this is the case, scramming the reactor can at most reduce the power to 7% of its initial value.

 text: 346 The Time-Dependent Reactor It continues to drop according to the relation P = PIe-tiT where T = 80 sec. After 10 minutes, the power falls to P = 33.5e-(lOx60)/80 = 33.5e-7.5 = 0.0185 MW. [Ans.] Chap. 7 koo Not Equal to One In the second case, koo i= 1, we assume that the prompt neutron lifetime I p is very small, such that the neutron population jumps quickly to its new value, but there is little change in the precursor concentration.

This means that, for small reactivities, the first root of the equation is also small. In this case, the terms containing w in the denominator of Eq.

When a rod is used in the first manner, the effect is to place a reactor on a stable period. In this case, the rod worth is defined as the magnitude of the reactivity required to give the observed period. However, the worth of a rod used to keep a reactor critical is measured in tenns of the change in multiplication factor of the system for which the rod can compensate. Despite the fundamental difference in these two definitions of rod worth, it can be shown3 that these definitions of rod worth are essentially identical. In the present section, the worths of rods in a number of important situations are derived. Central Control Rod As a first example, consider the problem of calculating the worth of a rod of radius a inserted along the axis of a bare cylindrical thennal reactor of extrapolated radius R and height H. The calculations are considerably simplified if it is assumed that when the rod is withdrawn from the reactor, the hole left by the rod is filled with core material and, contrariwise, when the rod is inserted, a cylinder of core material is extruded. Suppose that the reactor is just critical when the rod is out of the reactor. The neutron flux then has the shape shown in Fig. 7.5, which is detennined by the equation (7.51) where B5 is the usual buckling of a bare cylindrical reactor. If the rod is now fully inserted into the reactor, the flux takes on the fonn indicated in Fig. 7.5, owing to the absorption of neutrons in the rod. The shape of the flux can be found from the 3Lamarsh, 1. R. Nuclear Reactor Theory, p. 499 (see references).

From modified one-group theory, the multiplication factor of the initially crit­ical reactor is given by k _ koo o -1 + B2M2 = 1, o T while the multiplication factor of the reactor with the rod inserted is koo k= . 1 + B2M;' According to Eq.

(7.53) can be written as 2M2 Bof1B Pw = 1 + B6 M;' , where f1B = B -Bo. (7.53) (7.54)

page number: 368
 text: 350 The Time-Dependent Reactor Chap. 7 To compute Pw, it is necessary to solve Eqs. (7.51) and (7.52) and determine B5 and B2, the lowest eigenvalues in each case. With the rod out, B5 is given by the formula derived in Chapter 6-namely, 2 = (2.405)2 (!!-.)2 Bo '" + '" R H The calculation of B2 is somewhat more difficult for two reasons. First, the ge­ometry of the problem is more complicated with the rod present. Second, the rod, especially if it is a strong absorber of neutrons, tends to distort the flux to such an extent that diffusion theory is not valid in its vicinity. This second difficulty can be circumvented by requiring the flux to satisfy the following boundary condition at the surface of the rod: 1 d¢T ¢T dr 1 d' (7.55) where d is called the extrapolation distance. This is the same procedure as was used in Chapter 5 in connection with the diffusion of neutrons near a bare surface, where diffusion theory also was not valid. Values of d have been computed using advanced theoretical methods. The results of these calculations can be expressed approximately by the following for­mula4 -aLt + 0.9354 d=2.131D---­aLt + 0.5098 (7.56) where D is the thermal neutron diffusion coefficient and Lt is the macroscopic total cross-section, both for the reactor material surrounding the rod. Equation (7.56) is valid for strongly absorbing rods (i.e., black rods).5 Other formulas for d for less strongly absorbing rods (i.e., grey rods) are found in the literature. The solving of Eq. (7.52) subject to the boundary condition Eq. (7.55), as well as the usual conditions at the surface of the reactor, is somewhat tedious and is not given here. In particular, the calculation of B2 requires the solution of a complicated transcendental equation. However, in the case where B2 is not too different from B5, this equation can be solved for � B. When this is substituted into Eq. (7.54), the following result is obtained: = T 0.116 In - 7.43M2 [ ( R ) dJ-Pw (1 + B5Mi)R2 + 2.405a + a 4B. Pellaud, Nuclear Science and Engineering 33, 169 (1968).

 text: Sec. 7.3 Control Rods and Chemical Shim 351 Equation (7.57) gives the worth of a black control rod located at the center of a bare cylindrical thennal reactor as computed by modified one-group theory. Example 7.7 A small bare reactor is a square cylinder (i.e., H = 2R) of extrapolated height (i.e., ii = H + 2d) 70 cm. The reactor consists of a mixture of ordinary water and 235U at room temperature. What is the worth of a black control rod 1.90 cm in radius inserted at the center of the reactor? Solution. It is first necessary to compute M; for the critical reactor.

Thus, both D and 1:, in Eq. (7.56) have the values for water alone-namely, D = 0.16 cm (from Table 5.2) and 1:, = 3.443 cm-1 (from Table 11.3). Introducing these values together with a = 1.90 cm into Eq. (7.56) gives 1.90 x 3.443 + 0.9354 d = 2.131 x 0.16 x = 0.361 cm. 1.90 x 3.443 + 0.5098 Inserting the prior results for M;, B5, and d into Eq.

 text: 352 The Time-Dependen t Reactor Chap. 7 Cluster Control Rods In practice, almost no reactors are controlled with only one rod as described in the preceding discussion. This is because the presence of a single, strongly absorbing rod would lead to the large distortion of the flux indicated in Fig. 7.5, and this in tum would give rise to an undesirable power and temperature distribution in the reactor core. At the same time, reliance on only one rod to control a reactor is not wise from the standpoint of safety since this provides no reserve control capability in case the rod does not function properly. Many research reactors, which operate at relatively low power--on the order of a few megawatts or less-are controlled with a small number of rods usually ar­ranged in a symmetric fashion about the center of the core. Formulas for the worth of such rings of rods have been derived, but are too complicated to be reproduced here. They are found in the references at the end of the chapter. However, with power reactors operating as they do at high power densities and high temperatures, it is extremely important that the neutron flux remain as uniform as possible throughout the core. For this reason, power reactors always contain a great many rods. There are two different types of control rod systems in general use today. In one of these, a number of small cylindrical rods, about the size of the fuel rods, are attached at one end by a metal plate called a spider and move together through individual sheaths in a fuel assembly as shown in Fig. 7.6. Each group of rods so connected is known as a cluster control rod. A typical power reactor may have 50 or 60 such clusters, each containing on the order of 20 rods, giving about 1,000 individual control rods. The rods are composed of a strong neutron absorber. Various alloys of cadmium, indium, and silver, hafnium, or steel containing boron have been used in some reactors-more recently, hollow rods filled with boron carbide (B4C) powder (sometimes the boron is enriched with the isotope lOB) have been employed. In many power reactors, the control rod drives (i.e., the mechanisms that in­sert or withdraw the rods) are interconnected electrically or ganged so that several rods move simultaneously in response to a signal from the reactor operator. Con­solidated Edison's Indian Point Reactors Nos. 2 and 3, for example, each contain 61 cluster control rods, which are divided into four independently moving groups or banks. As far as the reactor operator is concerned, therefore, each reactor has only four independent control rods. Although the reactor operator obviously must have the final control over the operating conditions, power level, and so on, of a reactor, the ordinary movement of the rods in most power reactors is controlled, subject to operator intervention, by an on line computer. This computer accepts as input data the values of a num­ber of reactor parameters, such as the pressure, temperature, power density, and so on, which are continuously measured by various monitors located throughout the

Using these data, the computer determines what motions of the control rods are necessary to maintain a desired pressure or temperature or to obtain the optimum power distribution within the reactor. The results of these computations are automatically transmitted into the required movement of the rods. Such com­puter control over rod motion leads to longer core life. At the same time, because

page number: 372
 text: 354 The Time-Dependent Reactor Chap. 7 the control rods are used in an optimum manner, the total worth of the rods required for the control of the reactor is reduced over what would be necessary if the rods were moved all together or haphazardly. An estimate of the worth of a large number of rods can be obtained by com­paring the multiplication factor of the reactor with the rods inserted to the multi­plication factor when the rods are withdrawn. The value of k with the rods present can be found by the Wigner-Seitz method, which was used in Section 6.8 for the calculation of heterogeneous reactors. Thus, the reactor core is divided into unit cells, with a control rod at the center of each cell, and the diffusion equation is solved in the equivalent cylindrical cell. The resulting formula for Pw is JR Pw = 1 -JR' (7.59) where JR is a parameter known as the rod utilization and is equal to the fraction of the fission neutrons slowing down within a unit control cell that are absorbed in the control rod. This, in tum, is given by the expression (7.60) In this equation, a is the control rod radius; d is the extrapolation distance at the surface of the rod; y = a/ LT, where LT is the thermal diffusion length in the reactor core material; z = Rc / LT, where Rc is the radius of the equivalent cell; and E(y, z) is the lattice function defined by Eq. (6.116). An example of the use of these formulas follows. Example 7.S Suppose that the reactor described in Example 7.7 were to be controlled by 100 evenly spaced black control rods 0.508 cm in radius. Estimate the total worth of the rods. Solution. The cross-sectional area of the reactor is n(35)2 cm2 One one-hundredth of this is the area of one control cell. The radius Rc of this cell is therefore determined from so that Rc = 3.5 cm. The thermal diffusion area is given by and inserting f = 0.583 from Example 7.7 and L}M = 8.1 cm� gives L} = 3.38 cm2. Thus, LT = 1.85 cm, al LT = 0.275, and Rei LT = 1.89.

[Ans.] Cruciform Rods 355 Another type of control rod that has been widely used in power reactors is the cruciform rod, which consists of two crossed blades as shown in Fig. 7.7. These rods have the advantage of fitting snugly into the comers and along the edges of the fuel assemblies as indicated in Fig. 7.8, and they have good physical integrity. Figure 7.8 also shows the array of 137 cruciform rods used in a 780-MWe boiling water reactor plant. Cruciform rods are made of either solid neutron-absorbing metal or hollow, cross-like forms filled with rods of neutron absorber-often these rods are hollow tubes filled with B4C powder as in the cluster control rod. This latter type of construction is used for the rod illustrated in Fig. 7.7. Because of the complicated geometry of cruciform rods, it is not possible to determine their worth exactly by analytic calculations. In the actual design of reactors containing such rods, their worth is computed on fast digital computers using two-or three-dimensional multigroup codes. However, a rough estimate of their worth can be found from the following simple method. To begin with, the reactor is again divided into cells, but this time the unit cell is bounded by the blades of two rods as shown in Fig. 7.9. Next, this cell is replaced by the simple slab geometry of Fig. 7.10, obtained by bending the blades

First, the neutron diffusion equation in slab geometry is solved to deter­mine the current density of neutrons flowing into the rod. Then this current density is multiplied by the actual surface area of the blades to give the number of neu­trons absorbed per second by the rod. Finally, this number, divided by the number

As shown there, the final value of fR to be used in Eq. (7.59) is 4(1 -a)LT 1 h= , (m -2a)2 dj LT + coth[(m -2a)j2LT] where the parameters 1, a, and m are those shown in Fig. 7.9, d is the extrapolation distance at a planar surface, and LT is the thermal diffusion length in the core material. If the blades are black to thermal neutrons, as they usually are, then d = 2.131D-a conclusion that can be reached either by placing a = 00 in Eq. (7.56) or by using Eq. (5.22) for a bare planar surface. The latter is equivalent to a black planar surface since, in both cases, neutrons are irretrievably lost. Example 7.9 Cruciform rods used for the control of a certain boiling-wa ter reactor consist of blades 9.75 in wide and 0.312 in thick. The rods are placed in a rectangular array, with 44.5 cm between the centers of the nearest rods. The parameters of the core ma­ terial are LT = 1.2 cm and �a = 0.20 cm. The rods are black to thermal neutrons. Calculate the worth of the rods. Solution. The dimensions of the rod in cm are I = 9.75 x 2.54/2 = 12.38 cm and a = 0.312 x 2.54/2 = 0.396 cm. In view of Fig. 7.9, a closest distance between rods of 44.5 cm means that m = 44.5/-./2 = 31.5 cm. The value of D for computing d is found from so that - -2 2 D = �aLT = 0.20 x (1.2) = 0.288 cm, d = 2.131D = 0.614 cm. Introducing these values into Eq.

 text: Sec. 7.3 Control Rods and Chemical Shim 359 Control Rods in Fast Reactors Only a few fast reactors have been designed or built as of this writing. Thus, it is not possible to state with certainty what types of control rods will come into general use as fast reactor design becomes standardized. However, rods filled with B4C, enriched in the isotopes lOB, are used in the French-designed Super Phenix and appear to hold considerable promise for this type of reactor. This is because the absorption cross-section of boron is still significant at high neutron energies, whereas aa drops rapidly to very low values with increasing energy for most other substances. In any case, the absorption cross-sections of all materials, including boron, are relatively small at the energies of importance in fast reactors. Thus, aa for normal boron in the energy range of about 0.1 MeV to 0.4 MeV is only 0.27 b. The absorption mean free path, Aa, of neutrons of this energy in media containing boron is therefore relatively large. With B4C, for instance, at a density of 2 g/cm3 (this is 80% of theoretical density), the atom density of boron NB = 0.087 X 1024 atoms/cm3, and so Aa = 1/0.087 x 0.27 = 42.6 cm. This is considerably larger than the thickness of any control rod likely to be used in a fast reactor. The fact that at the relevant energies Aa is much larger than control rod di­mensions means that the neutron flux inside the rod is more or less the same as it is in the surrounding medium. Therefore, for calculational purposes, the boron contained in the rod can be assumed to be uniformly distributed in the reactor (or in a region thereof). This makes it possible to estimate the worth of control rods in fast reactors by elementary means. By contrast, the situation in a thermal reactor is just the opposite. There is a marked drop in the flux near a control rod in a thermal reactor, making it much more difficult to analyze. The only effect of a uniformly distributed poison on the multiplication factor of a fast reactor is to change the value of f-the fuel utilization (see Section 6.1). The transport properties of the reactor are little affected by the presence of the boron. According to Eq. (6.56), the multiplication factor for a fast reactor is given by where PL is the non leakage probability. Thus, it follows from the definition of rod worth in Eq. (7.53) that ko -k fo -f Pw = -k-= -I--(7.61) where the symbols without the subscript refer to the reactor with the rods inserted.

Estimate the worth of the rods using one-group theory. Solution. First it is necessary to find the total number of boron atoms in all the rods. The total volume of the rods is 5 x 7r(2.5)2 x 76 = 7,460 cm3 The mass of B4C in the rods is therefore 2.0 x 7,460 = 14,920 g. The molecular weight of B4C is 4 x 10.8 + 12.0 = 55.2, and so the total number of atoms of boron in the reactor is then 4 x 14,920 x 0.6 x 1024 024 --------- = 649 x 1 55.2 The atom density of boron averaged over the whole volume of the reactor is 649 X 1024 NB = 4 = 2.14 X 10-3 x 1024 atoms/cm3 37r(41.7)3 Using the value aa = 0.27 b gives l:aB = 2.14 X 10-3 x 0.27 = 0.000578 cm-l Substituting this value of LaB, together with LaF = 0.00833 and baC = 0.000019 from Example 6.3, into Eq.

 text: Sec. 7.3 Control Rods and Chemical Shim 361 In actual fast reactor design, the worth of the control rods is computed using mUltigroup codes and a computer. For such accurate calculations, the rods are ho­mogenized only over those regions of the reactor where the rods are located. Also, because the absorption cross-section increases rapidly with decreasing energy, it is necessary to take into account the dip in the group fluxes inside the rods in the lower energy groups. Partially Inserted Rods Up to this point, it has been assumed that the rods are either fully inserted or fully withdrawn from the reactor core. In practice, some or all of the rods are inserted at the time of startup of a reactor and are slowly withdrawn to keep the reactor critical as the fuel is consumed and as fission product poisons accumulate. So it is necessary to know the worth of the rods as a function of their distance of insertion. This must also be known for rods that are more quickly inserted or withdrawn for the purpose of changing the power level. Let Pw (x) be the worth of one or more rods that are inserted the distance x, parallel to the axis of a cylindrical reactor core of total height H, and let Pw(H) be the worth of these rods when fully inserted. It has been found from experiments and can be also shown on theoretical grounds that Pw(x) and Pw(H) are approximately related by the formula [xl (2nx)] Pw(x) = Pw(H) H -2n sin H (7.63) This function Pw (x) is shown in Fig. 7.11, where it is observed that Pw (0) = 0 while x = Hand Pw(x) = Pw(H). 1.0 .--------.-------:::oo-� g Q.. 0.5 I-------Ic--"""' � Q.. 0.5 xlH 1.0 Figure 7.11 The worth of a partially inserted control rod as a function of the distance of insertion.

It is of some interest to compute the derivative of Pw(x)/ Pw(H): _I_dpw(x) = � [I _ cos (2JrX)] Pw(H) dx H H (7.64) This expression, which gives the fractional rate of change in reactivity per unit distance of movement of the rods, is plotted in Fig. 7.12. As shown in the figure, the reactivity changes very little per unit distance when the rod is first introduced into the reactor and also just as it is fully inserted. Physically, this is because, in these two instances, the end of the rod is moving through regions where the flux is very small and so few additional neutrons are absorbed in the rod as a result of its motion. However, in the region near the center of the core, the change in Pw (x) is the greatest because the flux is also greatest there. In many reactors, the problem of changing rod worth with distance of rod insertion is circumvented to some extent by programming the motions of the rods so that, as one rod or bank of rods moves out of the center of the reactor where the flux is highest, a second row or bank of rods automatically begins to be withdrawn. In this way, the decreasing worth of one rod or group of rods is compensated by the increasing worth of another. Example 7. 11 A bare square cylindrical reactor 70 cm in height is controlled by one control rod lo­ cated on the axis that is worth 6.5% when fully inserted (this is the reactor described in Example 7.7). If the reactor is critical when the rod is out, how far must the rod be inserted to introduce I % (negative) reactivity? Solution. Using Eq.

[Ans.] Chemical Shim It was pointed out in the introduction to this chapter that certain water-moderated and water-cooled reactors can be controlled in part by varying the concentration of boric acid (H3B03) in the water.6 Such chemical shim control cannot be used alone to control a reactor since the process of changing H3B03 concentration, although done remotely and automatically at the behest of the reactor operator, cannot be made to respond as quickly as control rods to sudden control requirements. There­fore, chemical shim is always used in conjunction with and as a supplement to mechanical control rods. When these two types of control mechanisms are present in a reactor, the control rods provide reactivity control for fast shutdown and for compensating for reactivity changes due to temperature changes 7 that accompany changes in power. The chemical shim is used to keep the reactor critical during xenon transients8 and to compensate for depletion of fuel and buildup of fission products over the life of the core. There are a number of reasons for using chemical shim. For one thing, it substantially reduces the number of control rods required in a reactor. Since con­trol rods and their drive mechanisms are expensive, this results in substantial cost savings. Furthermore, because the H3B03 is more or less uniformly distributed throughout the reactor core, changes in the reactivity of the system resulting from changes in the concentration of the H3B03 can be made without disturbing the power distribution in the core. Chemical shim affects the reactivity of a thermal reactor primarily by chang­ing the value of the thermal utilization. The boron has comparatively little effect on the transport properties of the core, especially in a reactor having a fairly uniform flux distribution. The worth of a given concentration of boric acid can therefore be computed from Eq. (7.62), which was derived from unifonnly distribllted boron in 6The solubility of H3B03 is 63.5 g/liter at room temperature, 267 g/liter at 100°C. 7This effect is discussed in Section 7.4. 8These are discussed in Section 7.5.

For a thennal reactor, this equation takes the fonn �aB Pw = , �aF + �aM Chap. 7 (7.65) where �aB, �aF, and �aM are, respectively, the macroscopic thennal average cross-sections of the boron, fuel, and moderator (including coolant and structural material). Dividing the numerator and denominator of Eq.

Substituting this result into Eq. (7.66) then gives LaB Pw = (l -fo)=-. LaM (7.67) The concentration of H3B03 is usually specified in parts per million (ppm) of water--one ppm meaning one gram of boron per 106 grams of H20. If C is the concentration in ppm, then the ratio of the mass of boron to the mass of water is mB = C x 10-6 mw The atomic weight of boron is 10.8 and the molecular weight of water is 18.0. The ratio of the atom density of boron to the molecular density of water is therefore NB 18.0 6 -= -- x C x 10-, Nw 10.8 and the tenn LaB/LaW in Eq.

 text: Sec. 7.4 Temperature Effects on Reactivity 365 the control rods are worth 8.5%, what is the minimum H3B03 concentration in ppm and g/liter of unit-density water that is necessary to hold down the reactor-that is, to keep it from becoming critical? Solution. The shim must be worth 20.5 -8.5 = 12%. Then using Eq. (7.68), Pw X 103 C= ----1.92(1 -fo) 0.12 X 103 1.92(1 _ 0.930) = 893 ppm. [Ans.] The molecular weight of H3B03 is 61.8. Therefore, the shim system must con­ tain (61.8/10.8) x 893 = 5110 g of H3B03 per 106 g of water. At unit density, 106 g of water occupies 103 liters. The concentration of the boric acid is thus 5,110 g per 103 liters = 5.11 g/liter. [Ans.] It should be noted that, in this example, the control rods alone do not have sufficient reactivity to keep the reactor from going critical at the beginning of core life. This is actually the case in many PWRs. 7.4 TEMPERATURE EFFECTS ON REACTIVITY As noted at the beginning of this chapter, many of the parameters that detennine the multiplication factor of a reactor depend on temperature. As a result, a change in the temperature leads to a change in k and alters the reactivity of the system. It is now shown that this effect has an important bearing on the operation of a reactor and, ultimately, the safety of the system. Temperature Coefficients The extent to which the reactivity is affected by changes in temperature is described in tenns of the temperature coefficient of reactivity, denoted as aT. This is defined by the relation dp a -­T -dT' (7.69) where p is the reactivity and T is the temperature. Introducing the definition of p from Eq. (7.26)-namely, and differentiating gives k -1 1 p= --=l--k k (7.70)

page number: 384
 text: 366 The Time-Dependent Reactor Chap. 7 In all cases of interest, k is close to unity and so Eq. (7.70) can be written approxi­matelyas 1 dk aT = --. kdT (7.71) This equation is more convenient than Eq. (7.69) for calculational purposes and is often taken as the definition of aT. According to Eq. (7.71), aT is equal to the fractional change in k per unit change in temperature and has units of (degrees)-I The response of a reactor to a change in temperature depends on the algebraic sign of aT. Consider first the situation when aT is positive. Since k is always posi­tive, dk/dT is also positive, which means that an increase in T leads to an increase in k. Now suppose that for some reason the temperature of the reactor increases. This increases the value of k, which, in tum, leads to an increase in the power level of the reactor, giving rise to a further increase in the temperature, another increase in k, and so on. Thus, with aT positive, an increase in temperature leads to ever­increasing temperature and power until the reactor is either shut down by outside intervention or it melts down. However, suppose the reactor temperature were decreased. If aT is positive, a decrease in T leads to a decrease in k. This reduces the reactor power, which reduces the temperature, giving a further decrease in k, and so on, until the reactor eventually shuts down. Thus, if aT > 0, an increase in T leads to meltdown, a decrease in T to shutdown-in the absence of external intervention. The situation is quite different when aT is negative. In this case, dk/dT is negative, and an increase in T gives a decrease in k. Now an increase in reactor temperature leads to a decrease in power, which tends to decrease the temperature and return the reactor to its original state. Furthennore, a decrease in T results in an increase in k, so that if T goes down the power goes up and again the reactor tends to return to its original state. Clearly, a reactor with positive aT is inherently unstable to changes in its temperature, whereas a reactor having a negative aT is inherently stable. It must be recognized that the temperature ordinarily does not change uni­fonnly throughout a reactor. For instance, an increase in reactor power, is reflected first by a rise in the temperature of the fuel since this is the region where the power is generated. In a thennal reactor, the coolant and moderator temperatures do not increase until heat has been transferred from the fuel to these regions. It is neces" sary in discussing temperature coefficients to specify the component whose tem­perature is undergoing a change. Thus, the fuel temperature coefficient is defined as the fractional change in k per unit change in fuel temperature, the moderator temperature coefficient is the fractional change in k per unit change in moderator temperature, and so on.

page number: 385
 text: Sec. 7.4 Temperature Effects on Reactivity 367 Because the temperature of the fuel reacts immediately to changes in reactor power, the fuel temperature coefficient is also called the prompt temperature coef­ ficient, denoted as O!prompt . The value of O!prompt determines the first response of a reactor to changes in either fuel temperature or reactor power. For this reason, O!prompt is the most important temperature coefficient insofar as reactor safety is concerned. In the United States, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) will not license a reactor unless O!prompt is negative; all licensed reactors9 are thereby assured of being inherently stable. Nuclear Doppler Effect The prompt temperature coefficient of most reactors is negative owing to a phe­nomenon known as the nuclear Doppler effect. This effect, which admittedly is somewhat complicated, can be explained in the following way. For the moment, the discussion is restricted to thermal reactors. It is recalled from Chapter 3 that neutron cross-sections exhibit resonances at certain energies and that in the heavier nuclei these resonances are due almost entirely to absorption, not scattering. Throughout that chapter, it is tacitly assumed that the nuclei with which the neutrons interact are at rest in the laboratory reference frame. In particular, the Breit-Wigner formula, describing a resonance of width r at the energy En is based on this assumption. In fact, however, nuclei are located in atoms that are in continual motion owing to their thermal energy. As a result of these thermal motions, even a beam of strictly monoenergetic neutrons impinging on a target appears to the nuclei in the target to have a continuous spread in energy. This, in tum, has an effect on the observed shape of a resonance. Thus, it can be shown that when the cross-section is averaged over the motions of the nuclei, the resonance becomes shorter and wider than when the nuclei are at rest. Furthermore, the effect becomes more pronounced as the temperature of the target goes up, as indicated in Fig. 7.13. The change in shape of the resonance with temperature is called Doppler broadening. In Fig. 7.13, the unbroadened resonance for OaK was computed from the Breit-Wigner formula, since at this temperature there is no thermal motion. An important aspect of the Doppler effect is that, although the shape of a resonance changes with temperature, the total area under the resonance remains essentially constant. 9 All reactors in the United States must be licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) except those owned by the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, or the NRC itself.

Consider now neutrons slowing down in a thermal reactor past a particular resonance. The number of neutrons absorbed per cm3/sec in this resonance is given by (7.72) where ¢ (E) is the energy-dependent flux, ba (E) is the macroscopic absorption cross-section, and the integration is carried out over the resonance. Equation (7.72) can also be written as Fa = </Jav J 'Ea(E)dE, in which ¢av is the average value of the flux in the resonance. The remaining inte­gral is simply the total area under the resonance and, as just noted, this is a constant, independent of temperature. Therefore, it follows that the number of neutrons ab­sorbed in the resonance is proportional to the average flux in the resonance. It is not difficult to see that the value of ¢av depends on temperature. Thus, suppose the temperature increases. Then, as explained earlier, the magnitude of the absorption cross-section decreases due to the Doppler effect, and this, in tum, causes ¢av to increase. The situation is analogous to the placing of a neutron

If the cross-section of the absorber is increased, the neutron flux in its vicinity goes down; but if the cross-section is reduced, the flux obviously goes up. Finally, since ¢Jav increases with temperature and since the number of neu­trons absorbed in the resonance is proportional to ¢Jav, it must be concluded that resonance absorption increases with increasing temperature. This, of course, de­creases k and accounts for the negative value of the prompt temperature coefficient. To calculate (Yprompt for a thermal reactor, the multiplication factor may be written as (7.73) where P is the overall nonleakage probability (see Section 6.5). Next, the reso­nance escape probability, p, is singled out by taking logarithms: In k = In 1JT f E P + In p. Differentiating with respect to the temperature and holding all parameters constant except p then gives, or d 1 dk 1 dp -(lnk) = --(lnp) =-­dT kdT pdT (Yprompt = (Yprompt(P). From Eq.

Then both asM and VM are constant. Furthermore, the product NF VF, which is equal to the total number of fuel atoms in a fuel rod, does not change with temperature. The entire temperature dependence of p is therefore contained in [. Many measurements of resonance absorption have been carried out at differ­ent temperatures, and it has been found that I can be represented by the formula IOValues of �M �sM are given in Table 6.6.

This is because, for one thing, at the elevated ener­gies of interest in this type of reactor, the resonances are so close together in energy that they overlap, and their properties are less well known. In addition, the amount of resonance absorption depends in detail on the neutron spectrum, and this varies from reactor to reactor. Nevertheless, methods have been developed for computing this important temperature coefficient for fast reactors. One additional aspect of this problem should be mentioned. In a fast reactor, fissions as well as radiative capture occur following the absorption of neutrons in high-energy, overlapping resonances. Thus, in a fast reactor with a fuel mixture of, say, 239pu and 238U, an increase in temperature not only increases the parasitic capture of neutrons by the 238U, but also tends to increase the fission rate of the 239PU. The Doppler effect in this case is, so to speak, a mixed blessing. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure the safe operation of the reactor to include enough 238U in the system so that, on balance, the Doppler effect provides a negative value of CXprompt. This is not a serious restriction, however, since substantial amounts of 238U are nonnally present in this type of reactor to maximize the breeding gain. The Moderator Coefficient Although of less immediate importance than cxprompt. the moderator temperature co­efficient, CXmod, detennines the ultimate behavior of a reactor in response to changes in fuel temperature. It also detennines the effect on the reactor of changes in the temperature of the coolant entering the system. It is desirable for CXmod to be nega­tive to ensure stability during nonnal operation and during accident conditions. II A Celsius (centigrade) degree is the same size as a Kelvin degree.

 text: 372 The Time-Dependent Reactor Chap. 7 In a thermal reactor, an increase in the moderator temperature affects the mul­tiplication factor in two ways: (a) the temperature at which thermal cross-sections are computed is changed, and (b) the physical density of the moderator changes owing to thermal expansion. Of these effects, the second is ordinarily the more significant. To compute amod, k is first written as in Eq. (7.73): k = 1JT /pEP The value of 1JT is not a function of moderator temperature. Although E does de­pend to some extent on the moderator density, it can also be taken to be independent of T Taking logarithms of both sides ofEq. (7.73) and differentiating with respect to T gives, (7.79) The moderator coefficient is therefore the sum of three other temperature coeffi­cients. Consider first aT(/). It is recalled that / is equal to the probability that a thermal neutron eventually is absorbed in fuel, and is given by the ratio of the macroscopic cross-section of the fuel to that of the fuel, moderator, and coolant taken together. If the fuel and moderator are both solids and the reactor is cooled by a weakly absorbing gas, then a change in moderator temperature does not alter the total number of absorbers in the system and / remains more or less constant. In this case, aT (/) is essentially zero. The situation is quite different if, as in pressurized-water reactors, the fuel is a solid, but the coolant and/or moderator are liquids. Now because the coefficients of expansion for liquids are greater than for solids, and since the liquid in a reac­tor is always held in a metallic vessel of some sort, an increase in the moderator temperature results in the expulsion of some liquid from the reactor. The amount of parasitic absorption of thermal neutrons in the moderator and coolant is thereby reduced relative to the absorption in the fuel, with the result that / increases. It may be concluded that, in this case, aT (/) is positive. This effect is especially pro­nounced when a chemical shim is present because some of the boron is expelled along with the moderator coolant. Consider next aT(p). In Eq. (7.75) the only factor that depends on the moder­ator temperature is �sM VM, which is proportional to the total number of moderator­coolant atoms in the reactor. If the moderator is a solid, this number does not change with temperature, and aT (p) is zero. However, with a liquid moderator, as explained earlier, an increase in temperature leads to the ejection of some of the moderator. This decreases the value of �sM VM and leads to a decrease in p. Thus, for a liquid moderator coolant, aT (p) is negative.

page number: 391
 text: Sec. 7.4 Temperature Effects on Reactivity 373 The temperature coefficient of the nonleakage probability is also negative. This may be seen from Eqs. (6.71) and (6.72), from which the overall nonleakage probability (which includes the leakage of both fast and thermal neutrons) is given by 1 P = ------------------(l + B2L})(l + B2iT) , (7.80) where B2 is the buckling, L} is the thermal diffusion area, and iT is the age of fission neutrons to thermal. The value of B2 is determined by the dimensions of the system, which do not change significantly when the moderator temperature changes. From the definition of L} = D /L.a (see Eq. 5.62) and iT = Dd L.l (see Eq. 5.69), it is easy to see that both of these parameters vary inversely with the square of the physical density Pd12 of the medium provided the medium is uniform and homogeneous. For a solid fuel and solid moderator, the values of L} and iT depend in a complex way on the densities of these two media. However, a change in temperature of a solid moderator has little effect on its density; P is therefore constant and aT (P) = O. With solid fuel and liquid moderator coolant, L} and iT vary as pin, where n is a number less than 2. In this case, 1 P -------------------(1 + ��)(l+ �;)' (7.81) where C1 and C2 are constants. Now if T increases, Pd decreases because of the expulsion of liquid, and P goes down. It follows that aT (P) is negative. A negative value of aT(P) means that the leakage of neutrons increases with increasing moderator temperature. This, in tum, is simply due to the fact that, other things being equal, neutrons diffuse more readily through less dense media. How­ever, there is another way to view these conclusions. Clearly a fast neutron that does not escape from a reactor core (and is not absorbed in a resonance) must slow down in the core. When the moderator density decreases and faster neutrons es­cape, the number of neutrons moderated to thermal energies also decreases. Thus, a decrease in moderator density leads to (a) a decrease in thermal neutron absorp­tion in the moderator--a positive effect on k; and (b) a decrease in the moderation of fast neutrons--a negative effect on k. Whether amod is positive or negative de­pends (aside from the effect on the resonance escape probability, which is always negative) on whether a given moderator "absorbs more than it moderates" or "mod­erates more than it absorbs." In the important case of water, it can be shown that this material moderates more than it absorbs, so that amod is negative. However, 12The symbol Pd is used in the present discussion for density rather than P to avoid confusion with the reactivity.

 text: 374 The lime-Dependen t Reactor Chap. 7 this situation can be reversed if there is too much boron present in the water as a chemical shim leading to a positive (Xmod.13 The negative moderator coefficient has an important effect on the control of a pressurized-water reactor following changes in the demand for power from the turbine. For instance, suppose that the throttle (control valve) on the turbine is closed somewhat in response to a reduction in load. This ultimately leads to an increase in the temperature of the coolant water entering the reactor since less energy is being extracted from the steam passing through the turbine. Because (Xmod is negative, this leads, in tum, to a decrease in reactor power. However, had the load been increased, the effect would have been the reverse, and the reactor power would have increased. In either case, the reactor automatically responds to changes in load in the desired manner. This behavior of a reactor is called automatic load following. The Void Coefficient Consider a liquid-moderated and/or liquid-cooled reactor. At a point where the liquid boils, the volume occupied by the vapor is essentially a void since the density of the vapor is so much less than that of the liquid. The void fraction, x, is defined as the fraction of a given volume occupied by voids. For instance, if 25% of a volume is occupied by vapor and the remainder is liquid, then x = 0.25. Changing the void fraction in a reactor nonnally affects the reactivity of the system. This phenomenon is described in tenns of the void coefficient, (Xv, which is defined as, dp £¥v=-, dx (7.82) where p is the reactivity and x is the void fraction. Clearly, (Xv is a dimensionless number. In view of the previous definition, it follows that, if (Xv is positive, an increase in the void fraction leads to an increase in reactivity. This is obviously not a desir­able state of affairs since an increase in reactivity gives an increase in power, which would gives rise to additional boiling, more voids, a further increase in reactivity, and so on, until much of the liquid is boiled away and the core melts down. By contrast, with (Xv negative, an increase in x gives a decrease in reactivity and in power, and the reactor tends to be restored to its initial condition. Therefore, it is clearly desirable for (Xv to be negative. The presence of voids alters the average density of the moderator or coolant. In particular, if the void fraction is x, the average density of the mixture of liquid 13Some reactors operate very early in life with a small positive temperature coefficient due to the need for high boron concentration with the new fuel designs.

However, Pg is usually much less than PI (except near the critical point of the substance in question), and so Eq. (7.83) can be written as Pd = (1 -X)PI. (7.84) As would have been expected, Pd decreases as x increases. Since changing x changes the average density of the moderator or coolant, the value of ay is related, in the case of thermal reactors, to the value of amod. It is recalled that, with a moderator coolant such as water, which moderates more than it absorbs, a decrease in density has a negative effect on the reactivity. It follows that this is also the case with the void coefficient. With water reactors, provided the thermal absorption cross-section is not made too high by the addition of a chemical shim, an increase in void fraction decreases the reactivity and ay is negative. The negative void coefficient is used to provide boiling-water reactors with automatic load following. This is accomplished by coupling the load demand on the turbine to the recirculation flow system of the reactor (see Fig. 4.4). An increase in turbine load leads to increased recirculation flow, whereas a reduction in load results in decreased recirculation flow. In the case of increased turbine load, the increase in the recirculation flow through the reactor initially sweeps out a portion of the voids in the core. This reduction in void content increases the reactivity of the system because ay is negative, and this causes the reactor to produce more power. Eventually, a larger void content is reestablished at a higher power level. In equilibrium, the core produces the exact power required by the turbine. Had the turbine load been decreased, the recirculation flow would have been reduced, the void content would have gone up, and the reactor power would have decreased, again following turbine demand. The situation regarding the void coefficient of sodium-cooled fast reactors is more complex. Sodium does not absorb neutrons to any great extent, so that the expUlsion of coolant from the reactor due to the formation of voids has only a negligible effect on the overall absorption of neutrons in the system. However, the sodium slows down neutrons by inelastic scattering at high energy and by elastic scattering at the lower end of the energy spectrum. The removal of sodium due to void formation reduces these moderating effects. As a result, the neutron spec­trum in the reactor becomes harder-that is, more energetic. It is remembered from Chapter 4, however (see Fig. 4.2), that 17, the average number of fission neutrons released per neutron absorbed in fuel, increases rapidly with incident neutron en­ergy for all of the fissile nuclides at fast reactor energies. Thus, as a consequence of

page number: 394
 text: 376 The Time-Dependent Reactor Chap. 7 the formation of voids, the average value of rJ goes up and the reactivity increases. This tends to make llv positive. Besides hardening the neutron spectrum, an increase in the void fraction in­creases the neutron leakage because of the reduced density of the sodium. This tends to make llv negative. Therefore, the sign of llV depends on which effect is greater-the increase in rJ or the increase in neutron leakage. In practice, the sign of llV is a function of the location where a void forms in the reactor. Thus, if a void occurs near the center of a large reactor, the increase in leakage from this region is of little consequence since the neutrons are merely absorbed in another part of the system. In this region, llV is positive. In contrast, if a void forms near the outside of the core, the additional neutrons that escape are lost from the core (at least some of them are), and in this case llV is negative. Precisely how large sodium-cooled fast reactors can be built to provide a negative llV in all parts of the system or how such reactors can be controlled with positive values of llV in some regions has not been settled as of this writing since so few fast reactors have been built. 7.5 FISSION PRODUCT POISONING All fission products absorb neutrons to some extent, and their accumulation in a reactor tends to reduce its multiplication factor. Since absorption cross-sections decrease rapidly with increasing neutron energy, such fission product poisons are of the greatest importance in thermal reactors. This section considers only reactors of this type. To a good approximation, the only effect of fission product poisons on the multiplication factor is on thermal utilization. Thus, the reactivity equivalent of poisons in a previously critical reactor can be written as, k - ko f -fa p- --- ----k -f (7.85) where the parameters without a subscript refer to the poisoned reactor. In the ab­sence of poisons, fa is given by LaF fo=---- LaF + LaM' where LaF and LaM are the macroscopic thermal absorption cross-sections of the fuel and everything else except the fuel, respectively. With poisons present, f be­comes,

(7.85), the reactivity due to the poisons is then, 1-10 p= = I l:aP (7.86) l:aF + l:aM Not surprisingly, Eq. (7.86) is essentially the same (except for sign) as the expres­sion for the worth of a chemical shim, which is a uniformly distributed poison. Equation (7.86) can be put in a more convenient form by writing the multi­plication factor of the unpoisoned reactor as 14 rJT pE l:aF k = 1 = rJT IPE = ---- l:aF + l:aM vPEl: f l:aF + l:aM (7.87) (7.88) where l: f is the macroscopic fission cross-section. Solving Eq. (7.88) for l:aF + I:aM and inserting this into Eq. (7.86) gives p= �aP/�f (7.89) VPE Equation (7.89) is in a form suitable for calculation of fission product poisoning. Xenon-135 The most important fission product poison is 135Xe, whose thermal (2,200 mlsec) absorption cross-section is 2.65 x 106 b and is non-l/v (the non-l/v factor is given in Table 3.2). This isotope is formed as the result of the decay of 1351 and is also produced directly in fission. The 1351 is formed in fission and by the decay of 135Te (tellurium-135). These processes and their half-lives are summarized next: 135Te t Fission fJ­ -----+ 11 see Fission fJ­-----+ 6.7hr 135Xe � 135Cs � 135Ba(stable) t Fission 9.2hr 2.3 x J06yr 14Leakage of neutrons from the reactor core is ignored in the present treatment.

The effective yields of 1351 and 135Xe for the three fissile nuclei are given in Table 7.5; the decay constants of these isotopes are shown in Table 7.6. Because xenon is produced in part by the decay of iodine, the xenon concen­tration at any time depends on the iodine concentration. This, in tum, is detennined by the rate equation (7.90) where I is the number of 1351 atoms/cm3, YI is the effective yield (atoms per fission) of this isotope, and � f is the thennal fission cross-section.

However, several special solutions to these equations are now considered. Equilibrium Xenon Because the half-lives of 135Xe and 1351 are so short and the absorption cross­section of xenon is so large, the concentrations of these isotopes, in all reactors except those operating at very low flux, quickly rise to their saturation or equilib­rium values, 100 and X 00' These concentrations can be found by placing the time derivatives in Eqs.

(7.91), it can be seen that ¢x is the thennal flux at which the disappearance rates of 135Xe by neutron absorption and natural decay are equal.

(7.89), the reactivity equivalent of equilibrium xenon is found to be Yl + Yx ¢T p=---- ---VPE ¢x + ¢T (7.98) There are now two situations to be considered. First, if ¢T « ¢x, Eq. (7.98) reduces to p= (7.99) and it is seen that, in this low-flux case, p increases linearly with ¢T. However, if ¢T » ¢x, p takes on its maximum value Yl + Yx p= (7.100) VPE To get some idea of the magnitude of the equilibrium xenon poisoning ef­fect, suppose a reactor is fueled with 235U and contains no resonance absorbers or fissionable material other than 235U. In this case, p = E = 1, and Eq. (7.100) gives p = _ Yl + Yx = _ 0.066 = -2.73%, v 2.42 or about four dollars. This is the maximum reactivity due to equilibrium xenon in a 235U-fueled reactor. If the reactor contains resonance absorbers, the maximum reactivity is somewhat higher. Xenon after Shutdown-Reactor Deadtime Although the fission production of 135Xe ceases when a reactor is shut down, this isotope continues to be produced as the result of the decay of the 1351 present in the system. The xenon concentration initially increases after shutdown, although it eventually disappears by its own decay. If the iodine concentration at shutdown is 1o, its concentration at a time t later is given by, (7.101) Ins€rting this function into Eq.

 text: 382 The Time-Dependen t Reactor Chap. 7 shown in the figure, the reactivity rises to a maximum, which occurs at about 10 hours after shutdown, and then decreases to zero. It should be noted that the (neg­ ative) reactivity rise is greatest in reactors that have been operating at the highest flux before shutdown. This is true simply because the accumula ted concentration of 1351 at shutdown is greatest in these reactors. The postshutdown buildup of xenon is of little importance in low-flux reac­ tors, but may be troublesome in reactors designed to operate at high flux. In partic­ ular, if at any time after the shutdown of a reactor the positive reactivity available by removing all control rods is less than the negative reactivity due to the xenon, the reactor cannot be restarted until the xenon has decayed. This situation is in­ dicated in Fig. 7.14, where the horizontal line represents a hypothetical reserve reactivity of 20%. It is clear from the figure that, during the time interval from ta to tb, the reactor that previously operated at a flux of 5 x 1014 cannot be restarted. This period is known as the reactor deadtime. The existence of a deadtime can be of major significance in the operation of any high-flux reactor, but it is of greatest importance in mobile systems should they experience an accidental scram. This is especially true near the end of the core life when the available excess reactivity may be very small. In this case, the core life may be determined by the maximum xenon override capability of the reactor. It is not necessary to shut down a reactor for 135Xe to build up, although the buildup is greatest in this case. Any reduction in reactor power increases the con­ centration of 135Xe because less of this nuclide is being burned up in the lower flux. This is illustrated in Fig. 7.15(a), where the 135Xe buildup is shown following a 50% drop in power. In a similar way, any increase in reactor power is accompa­ nied by an initial decrease in 135Xe owing to the increased burnup of the 135Xe in the higher flux. This is shown in Fig. 7 .15(b). In this connection, it should be noted that the power levels of some of the reactors used by public utilities have to be changed on an almost continuing basis in response to the changing demands for electrical power of the consuming public. Figure 7 .16( a) shows the total electrical load of the Consolidated Edison Com­ pany of New York on an average working day. As indicated in the figure, the load drops sharply before midnight when people are going to bed, it continues to drop throughout the night, and finally picks up again shortly before dawn. If a nuclear power plant follows this load curve,15 the xenon reactivity in the reactor is as shown in Fig. 7 .16(b). This changing reactivity can be compensa ted for by adjusting the 15The minimum power that must be supplied at any time by a utility is called its base load; the varying demand above this level is called the peak load. Utilities nonnally use their newest and most efficient generating facilities to supply their base load and handle the variable peak load with their older and less efficient equipment. A reactor that is base loaded operates at full power for long periods of time with a more or less constant inventory of xenon.

Samarium-149 The thennal (2,200 m1sec) cross- section of 149Sm is 41,000 b and is non-l/v (see Table 3.2; the average thennal cross-section at 200e is 58,700 b). Although this isotope is of much less concern in a reactor than 135Xe, it is often included sepa­ rately in reactor calculations. 149Sm is not fonned directly in fission but appears as the result of the decay of 149Nd (neodymium- 149) as follows: 149Nd � 149Pm � 149Sm(stable) t Fission 1.7hr 53hr Because 149Nd decays comparatively rapidly to 149Pm (promethiu m-149), 149Pm may be assumed to be produced directly in fission with the yield of yp atoms per fission (see Table 7.5).

 text: Sec. 7.5 Fission Product Poisoning 385 Equilibrium Samarium Since the absorption cross-section of 149Sm is much less than that of 135Xe and the half-life of 149Pm is longer than those of 1351 and 135Xe, it follows that it takes somewhat longer for the promethium and samarium concentrations to reach their equilibrium values than it does for xenon. Nevertheless, in all reactors except those operating at very low flux, these isotopes come into equilibrium in, at most, a few days'time. When the time derivatives in Eqs. (7.105) and (7.106) are placed equal to zero, these equilibrium concentrations are found to be and The macroscopic absorption cr oss-section of equilibrium 149Sm is then baS = YPbf· Substituting in Eq. (7.89), this is equivalent to the reactivity yp p=--. VPE (7.107) (7.108) (7.109) (7.110) It should be particularly noted that this reactivity is independent of the flux or power of the reactor. By contrast, it is recalled that the reactivity due to 135Xe increases with flux. With the value of yp given in Table 7.5 for 235U, Eq. (7.110) gives 0.0107 P = ---= -0.442% 2.42 ' or about 68 cents, for a reactor in which p = E = 1. Samarium after Shutdown After shutdown, 149Sm builds up as the accumula ted 149Pm decays. However, un­ like 135Xe, which undergoes �-decay, 149Sm is stable and remains in a reactor until the system is brought back to critical, whereon it is removed by neutron absorption. With the concentrations of promethium and samarium at shutdown denoted by Po and So, respectively, the samarium concentration at the time t later is

If the promethium and samarium are at their equilibrium concentrations prior to shutdown, Po and So are given by Eqs. (7.107) and (7.108). The postshutdown reactivity due to 149Sm can then be written as p = -YP [1 + CPT (1 _ e-APt)] , VPE CPs (7.112) where CPs is defined as (7.113) at 20°C. Equation (7.112) is shown in Fig. 7.17 for a 235U-fueled reactor operated at four different values of CPT before shutdown.

Other Fission Product Poisons (7.114) In addition to 135Xe and 149Sm, many fission products are fonned in a reactor. Some of these are radioactive and have half-lives that are short compared with the average life of a reactor core (1-2 years). Others have absorption cross-sections that are so large that their effective half-life, 0.693/(A + aa4>T), is also short compared with core life. Such nuclides, as in the case of 135Xe and 149Sm, quickly reach saturation concentrations in the reactor, and these change only when the reactor power is changed or as the flux and fuel mass change over the life of the core. The reactivity associated with these fission products, which include among others 151Sm, 155Eu, 113Cd, and 157Gd, can be calculated in the same way as 135Xe and 149Sm. At the other extreme are the fission products that are either stable or whose half-lives or effective half -lives are long compared with core life. The fonnation of these nuclides pennanently alters the neutronic properties of a reactor, and such fission products are called permanent poisons. Studies have shown that these poisons accumula te at an average rate of approximately 50 b/fission. If all this cross-section is assumed to be associated with a single hypothetical nuclide having the cross­ section a p ::: 50 b, then the macroscopic cross-section of the pennanent poisons builds up according to the relation (7.115) The total accumulation during a time t is then (7.116) Once }: f and 4>T are known as a function of time and space, Eq. (7.116) can be evaluated. It is somewhat more tedious to compute the poisoning due to nuclides whose effective half-lives are comparable to the core lifetime-too long for the nuclides to saturate and too short for them to be considered penn anent. This involves the calculation of many decay chains over the life of the core, and the computations

[Ans.] 7.6 CORE PROPER TIES DURING LIFETIME 389 One of the most important and difficult problems in reactor design is the prediction of the properties of a reactor core throughout its life. How these properties change in time must be known to ensure that the reactor will operate safely throughout the lifetime of the core. The NRC specifies safety limits for the operation of every reactor at the time it is licensed. The reactor designer and operator must be certain that conditions do not develop in the system that can lead to a violation of these limits. The changing reactor properties also determine the length of time that a given reactor core will remain critical, producing power at the desired level. This is an important practical consideration. It obviously makes little sense for a public util­ ity to purchase a reactor that must be shut down every month for refueling, if it can obtain one that needs to be refueled every 2 years. However, it makes equally little sense to buy a core that has fuel enough to remain critical for 20 years when radiation damage is known to compromi se the fuel elements in one-tenth of this time. Burnup- Lifetime Calculations Computations of changing reactor properties are known as burnup calculations or lifetime calculations. Consider a problem of this type for a thermal reactor whose core consists of a uniform distribution of fuel assemblies, each containing the same number of identical fuel rods. The fuel is slightly enriched uranium dioxide. For simplicity, it is assumed that the reactor is controlled by a chemical shim system, so there are no control rod mot ions. At startup, the reactor is necessarily fueled with more fissile material than needed to become critical, and the excess reactivity of the fuel is held down by the chemical shim. Suppose that the reactor is first brought to critical from a clean (no fission product poisons), cold 16 (room temperature) condition. Then as the reactor heats 16Some reactors, including most PWRs, are brought to critical after the reactor has reached its normal operating temperature. This is accomplished by pumping the water coolant through the primary coolant system using the primary coolant pumps. The friction of the water flowing through the system raises the temperature to the operating level. Once this temperature has been reached, the control rods (or most of them) are withdrawn, and the reactor is brought to critical by boron dilution.

page number: 408
 text: 390 The Ti me-Depe ndent Reactor Chap. 7 up to its operating temperature-a process that takes several hours-the reactivity of the system tends to drop owing to the negative temperature coefficient. This drop in reactivity between cold and hot conditions is known as the temperature defect of the reactor. To compensa te for the temperature defect, the concentration of the boron shim must be reduced during the startup period to keep the reactor critical. The buildup of equilibrium 13SXe also requires dilution of the boron. Once the reactor is operating in a steady state at the desired power level, the neutron flux takes on the spatial distribution of the type described in Chapter 6 and shown in Fig. 6.5. As indicated in that figure, the thennal flux (and the fluxes of higher energy neutrons) is greatest at the center of the reactor. This means that fuel is consumed, fertile material is converted, and fission product poisons are produced more rapidly in this region than in other parts of the core. This, in tum, has the effect of reducing the flux in the center of the reactor relative to that on the outside. It follows that, although the reactor initially had unifonn properties, it becomes nonunifonn as time goes on. Since the analytical methods discussed in Chapter 6 do not apply to nonunifonn systems, the reactor properties must be detennined by numerical methods. In practice, bumup computations begin by dividing the time scale into a num­ ber of intervals of length /)..t. The multigroup diffusion equations are then solved at t = 0, the beginning of the first interval-that is, at beginning of the life of the core (BOL). This calculation gives the fluxes at BOL and the boron concentration required for the reactor to be critical. It is now assumed that the multi group fluxes computed for to remain constant through the first interval to the time tl = to + /)..t, and these fluxes are used to compute at tl the spatial distributions of fuel, converted material, and poisons as follows. Fuel If it is assumed that all of the 23SU is consumed as the result of thennal neutron absorption, the atom density at the point r and time t is detennined by the equation dN2s(r, t) ----= -N2S(r, t)aa2S¢T(r, t). dt (7.117) Since ¢T (r, t) = ¢T (r, to) and is constant during the first interval, it follows from Eq.

 text: Sec. 7.6 Core Properties during Lifetime 391 Some 241 Pu may also be fonned as a result of the successive capture by 239pu of two neutrons, especially if the 239pu is left in the reactor for a long time. The production of 241 Pu will be ignored in the present treatment. Neutrons are absorbed by 238U both at resonance and thennal energies. The number absorbed in resonance is (1 -p) multiplied by the number of neutrons that slow down per second in the reactor, where p is the resonance escape probability. This latter number is in which E is the fast fission factor, PF is the fast nonlea kage probability and the subscript 49 refers to the 239pu. The concentration of 239pu is then given by the rate equation dN49(r, t) _ ----= N28aa28f/lT(r, t) (7.119) dt +(1 -p)E PF[V25N25(r, t)a /25 + V49N49(r, t)a /49]f/lT(r, t) -N49(r, t)aa49f/lT(r, t) The first and last tenns in this equation are the rates of fonnation and disappearance of 239pU due to thermal neutron absorption; the concentration of the 238U is taken to be constant. Solving Eq. (7.119) gives at tl N28aa28 + (1 -p)E PFV25N25(r, to)a /25 N49(r, tl) = _ _ (7.120) a a49 -(1 -p)E PFV49a /49 x {1 -exp -[aa49 -(1 -p)EPFV49a/49]f/lT(r, to)�t}. For simplicity, the concentration of the 235U is assumed to remain constant relative to the buildup of 239pu. Poisons The concentrations of the fission product poisons can be calcu­ lated in a straightforward way, at least in the case of the saturating and pennanent poisons. For instance, the 135Xe concentration is easily obtained by solving the rate equations, Eqs. (7.90) and (7.91), with f/lT(r, t) = f/lT(r, to). However, the resulting fonnulas are complica ted and are not given here. From Eq. (7.116), the pennanent poison cr oss-section at tl is (7.121) For simplicity, the concentration of the 235U is assumed to remain constant relative to the buildup of 239pu. The non saturating nuclides must be calculated using an appropriate computer code, as was done to obtain Fig. 7.18.

If the reactor is assumed to be operated at constant power, the usual case in problems of this kind, the magnitude of the fluxes is obtained by requiring that the integral be satisfied, where P is the reactor power, V is the volume of the core, and � fer, tl) includes the fission cross-sections of both 235U and 239pu. The fluxes obtained in this way for t = tl are next used to compute new core properties at t2 = t} + fl.t; the multigroup calculations are repeated, the fluxes again being nonnalized to the reactor power; the fluxes at t2 are used to compute the properties at t3 = t2 + fl.t; and so on. At each stage of these computat ions, the boron concentration required for criticality is detennined. Besides providing a description of how the reactor prop­ erties change with time, the calculations give a curve of critical boron concentration as a function of time after startup. Such a curve, the result of calculations of the type just described, is shown in Fig. 7.19 for one of the PWR cores used by the Consolid ated Edison Company of New York. It is observed in Fig. 7.19 that, as expected, the critical boron concentration, after an initial drop due to temperature and xenon, decreases slowly and steadily E 8: d' .9 1500 E 1000 E Q) (J s:::: o (J c= o .... o � 500 1..--- Temperature defect and xenon 100 200 300 400 Time, days Figure 7.19 Boron concentration in a PWR required for the criticality as function of time after startup.

Unless rods are present in the core and can be removed, the reactor cannot remain critical at its original power level. However, this is not necessarily the end of life for the core. The reactor can be kept critical somewhat longer by gradually reducing power as the necessary positive reactivity is supplied by the negative temperature coefficient accompanying the decreasing reactor temperature and by the reduction in the xenon concentration due to the de­ creasing neutron flux. This process is referred to as coastdown. For many practical purposes, however, the time at which the boron concentration drops to zero in Fig. 7.19 is often used to define the end of core life. Optimum Design and Operation-Fuel Management Having once performed calculations of the type just described, which at every stage, except at t = to, involves the computation of the properties of a nonuni­ form reactor, it is reasonable to ask whether the original, clean core, with its uni­ form distribution of fuel, represents the optimum design for the system. Would it not be better perhaps to start with a core already having some sort of nonuniform distribution of fuel? This question has been studied in detail, and the uniform core is not the op­ timum design. To operate a reactor safely and efficiently, it is important that the power density be as flat-that is, uniform-as possible across the core. The uni­ formly loaded core, however, has severe power peaks near the center. By nonuni­ formly distributing the fuel the power density can be significantly flattened. At the same time, this leads to a longer core life for a given initial fuel loading. In addi­ tion, it is desirable to limit the flux reaching the reactor vessel so as to minimize radiation damage to the vessel and extend its life. Figure 7.20 shows a typical loading pattern used in the current generation of PWR cores. Each square represents one fuel assembly of the type shown in Fig. 4.10. With this arrangement, the enrichment of the fuel decreases from the outside of the core toward the center. At the time of refueling, the central assemblies with the lowest enrichment are replaced by fuel from the outer region with a higher enrichment, and fresh fuel is added to the core periphery. By loading and refueling the core in this way, the power distribution is much flatter across the core than it would be with a uniform fuel loading. To reduce the leakage of neutrons out of the core, and thus minimize the flux at the reactor vessel, some cores now replace the outer one or two rows of fuel pins by stainless steel rods. This lowers the radiation damage in the reactor vessel. The power distribution can also be flattened and the lifetime of the core extended by appropriate movement of the control rods. This procedure is used, in particular, in boiling water reactors. In addition, the current BWRs have a

(Courtesy of Westinghouse Electric Corporation.) nonuniform distribution of fuel within each fuel assembly to flatten the power across the assembly. This is shown in Fig. 7.21, where the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 represent, in that order, fuel rods of decreasing enrichment. The rods indicated by a zero contain no fuel. The problems discussed earlier-how fuel should be loaded and reloaded, how the control rods should be moved, and, in gener�l, how the controllable pa­ rameters of a reactor should be varied to optimize its performance and ensure the safe operation of the system-are matters referred to as fuel management. 17 Be­ cause of the essentially infinite variety of possible fuel loading and reloading pat­ terns, control rod movements (combined control rod movements and shim control, if both are present), and so on, fuel-management problems are often formidable. To handle such problems, multigroup lifetime computations of the type described ear­ lier must be performed repeatedly for a variety of different operating strategies, at considerable cost in computer time. Modem computer codes such as SIMULA T"b 17More properly, these problems form the subject of incore fuel management. Problems con­ cerned with the purchase or leasing of fuel, the reprocessing of spent fuel elements, and other matters related to the management of fuel outside of the reactor are usually called out-oj-core fuel manage­ ment.

Based on the results of the study of a particular core design, the fuel assemblies can be shuffled to maximize core life and flatten the flux. Since it is not always possible to accurately compute the day-to-day behavior of a reactor before it has gone into operation, many modem power reactors are equipped with online computers that continually analyze data from instruments monitoring the behavior of the system. The output from these computers is used for updating fuel-management decisions. Burnable Poisons Considerably more control reactivity is required before the startup of a new clean, cold core, that is loaded with fresh fuel, and during the core's early operating stages than is needed toward the end of the core life. To reduce these control requirements, it is common practice to place a burnable poison at selected loca­ tions in the core. This is a nuclide that has a large absorption cross-section which is

page number: 414
 text: 396 The Time-Dependen t Reactor Chap. 7 converted into a nuclide with a low absorption cross-section as the result of neutron absorption. Thus, the increase in reactivity accompanying the burnup of the poison compensates to some extent for the decrease in reactivity due to fuel burnup and the accumulation of fission product poisons. Burnable poisons reduce the number of control rods required in reactors that use rods for control, and thereby lower the cost of such reactors. In contrast, in water reactors controlled by a chemical shim, burnable poisons decrease the neces­ sary boron concentration. This is shown in Fig. 7.22, where the boron concentration with and without burnable poisons is indicated over the lifetime of the core. Re­ ducing the required shim is important in these reactors to ensure that the moderator temperature coefficient is negative. As pointed out in Section 7.3, this coefficient is negative only as long as the water moderates neutrons more than it absorbs them. Too much boron in the water reverses this condition and the moderator coefficient becomes positive. In practice, enough reactivity can be tied up in burnable poisons to give the desired negative moderator coefficient. A number of materials have been utilized for burnable poisons. Boron in var­ ious forms, including Pyrex glass, which contains approximately 12 W /0 boron oxide (B203), is used for this purpose. Recent BWRs and PWRs use gadolinia (Gd203) mixed with the V02 in several fuel rods of each fuel assembly. The gadolinia is zoned both radially and axially in the more advanced fuel designs. Recently, core power and performance have been increased by the use of even more sophistica ted core designs. These designs rely on the use of higher en­ richment fuel, usually 5 w/o enrichment, and extensive use of burnable poisons, 2500 .... \ \ No burnable poison ___ Burnable poison present \ \ \ , OC------'-------'---....L..------' Time after startup Figure 7.22 Boron shim with and without burnable poison.
