 text: 3 Interaction of Radiation with Matter The design of all nuclear systems-reactors, radiation shields, isotopic generators, and so on-depends fundamentally on the way in which nuclear radiation interacts with matter. In this chapter, these interactions are discussed for neutrons, y-rays, and various charged particles with energies up to about 20 MeV. Most of the radi­ation encountered in practical nuclear devices lies in this energy region. 3.1 NEUTRON INTERACTI ONS It is important to recognize at the outset that, since neutrons are electrically neutral, they are not affected by the electrons in an atom or by the positive charge of the nucleus. As a consequence, neutrons pass through the atomic electron cloud and interact directly with the nucleus. In short, neutrons collide with nuclei, not with atoms. Neutrons may interact with nuclei in one or more of the following ways. Elastic Scattering In this process, the neutron strikes the nucleus, which is almost always in its ground state (see Section 2.7), the neutron reappears, and the 52

 text: Sec. 3.1 Neutron Interactions 53 nucleus is left in its ground state. The neutron in this case is said to have been elas­ tically scattered by the nucleus. In the notation of nuclear reactions (see Section 2.10), this interaction is abbreviated by the symbol (n, n). Inelastic Scatteri ng This process is identical to elastic scattering except that the nucleus is left in an excited state. Because energy is retained by the nucleus, this is clearly an endothermic interaction. Inelastic scattering is denoted by the symbol (n, n'). The excited nucleus decays, as explained in Section 2.7, by the emission of y-rays. In this case, since these y-rays originate in inelastic scattering, they are called inelastic y-rays. Radiative Capture Here the neutron is captured by the nucleus, and one or more y-rays--called capture y-rays-are emitted. This is an exothermic inter­action and is denoted by (n, y). Since the original neutron is absorbed, this process is an example of a class of interactions known as absorption reactions. Charged-Particle Reactions Neutrons may also disappear as the result of absorption reactions of the type (n, ex) and (n, p). Such reactions may be either exothermic or endothermic. Neutron-Producing Reactions Reactions of the type (n, 2n) and (n, 3n) occur with energetic neutrons. These reactions are clearly endothermic since in the (n, 2n) reaction one neutron and in the (n, 3n) reaction 2 neutrons are extracted from the struck nucleus. The (n, 2n) reaction is especially important in reactors containing heavy water or beryllium since 2H and 9Be have loosely bound neutrons that can easily be ejected. Fission Neutrons colliding with certain nuclei may cause the nucleus to split apart-to undergo fission. This reaction, as noted in Chap. 2, is the principal source of nuclear energy for practical applications. Many of these reactions may be viewed as a two-step process involving the formation of a compound nucleus. For example, the scattering reactions, both elastic and inelastic, may be thought of as a process in which the neutron is first absorbed by the target nucleus to form a new nucleus whose atomic number is un­changed but whose mass number is increased by 1. Then depending on the specific process, the nucleus decays via neutron emission to produce the original nucleus plus a neutron. The product nucleus is left in the ground state or an excited state according to the type of scattering reaction involved. This model is particularly useful in understanding the fission process. Each of these interactions is discussed in this chapter. However, to describe quantitatively the various interactions, it is necessary to introduce certain parame­ters.

 text: 54 Interaction of Radiation with Matter Chap. 3 3.2 CROSS-S ECTIONS The extent to which neutrons interact with nuclei is described in terms of quantities known as cross-sections. These are defined by the following type of experiment. Suppose that a beam of monoenergetic (single-energy) neutrons impinges on a thin target of thickness X and area A as shown in Fig. 3.1. If there are n neutrons per cm3 in the beam and v is the speed of the neutrons, then the quantity 1= nv (3.1) is called the intensity of the beam. Since the neutrons travel the distance v cm in 1 sec, all of the neutrons in the volume v A in front of the target will hit the target in 1 sec. Thus, nvA = I A neutrons strike the entire target per second, and it follows that I A / A = I is equal to the number of neutrons striking the target per cm2/sec. Since nuclei are small and the target is assumed to be thin, most of the neutrons striking the target in an experiment like that shown in Fig. 3.1 ordinarily pass through the target without interacting with any of the nuclei. The number that do collide are found to be proportional to the beam intensity, to the atom density N of the target, and to the area and thickness of the target. These observations can be summarized by the equation Number of collisions per second (in entire target) = a IN AX, (3.2) where a, the proportionality constant, is called the cross-section. The factor N AX in Eq. (3.2) is the total number of nuclei in the target. The number of collisions per second with a single nucleus is therefore just a I. It follows that a is equal to the number of collisions per second with one nucleus per unit intensity of the beam. There is another way to view the concept of cross-section. As already noted, I A neutrons strike the target per second. Of these, a I interact with any given nucleus. Therefore, it may be concluded that aI a = AI A Neutrons in beam ,- - , \ \ \ - I -' I " '\ \ \ \ I , / / �I.----------v ----------� Figure 3.1 Neutron beam striking a target.

 text: Sec. 3.2 Cross-Sections 55 is equal to the probability that a neutron in the beam will collide with this nucleus. It is clear from Eq. (3.3) that a has units of area. In fact, it is not difficult to see that a is nothing more than the effective cross-sectional area of the nucleus, hence the tenn cross-section. Neutron cross-sections are expressed in units of barns, where 1 barn, abbre­viated b, is equal to 10-24 cm2 One thousandth of a bam is called a millibarn, denoted as mb. Up to this point, it has been assumed that the neutron beam strikes the entire target. However, in many experiments, the beam is actually smaller in diameter than the target. In this case, the prior fonnulas still hold, but now .A refers to the area of the beam instead of the area of the target. The definition of cross-section remains the same, of course. Each of the processes described in Section 3.1 by which neutrons interact with nuclei is denoted by a characteristic cross-section. Thus, elastic scattering is described by the elastic scattering cross-section, ae; inelastic scattering by the inelastic scattering cross-section, ai; the (n, y) reaction (radiative capture) by the capture cross-section, a y; fission by the fission cross-section, a f; and so on. The sum of the cross-sections for all possible interactions is known as the total cross-section and is denoted by the symbol at; that is (3.4) The total cross-section measures the probability that an interaction of any type will occur when neutrons strike a target. The sum of the cross-sections of all absorption reactions is known as the absorption cross-section and is denoted by aa. Thus, (3.5) where a p and aa are the cross-sections for the (n, p) and (n, a) reactions. As indicated in Eq. (3.5), fission, by convention, is treated as an absorption process. Similarly, the total scattering cross-section is the sum of the elastic and inelastic scattering cross-section. Thus, and Example 3.1 A beam of I-Me V neutrons of intensity 5 x 108 neutrons/cm 2-sec strikes a thin 12C target. The area of the target is 0.5 cm2 and is 0.05 cm thick. The beam has a cross­ sectional area of 0.1 cm2 At 1 Me V, the total cross-section of 12C is 2.6 b. (a) At what rate do interactions take place in the target? (b) What is the probability that a neutron in the beam will have a collision in the target?

 text: 56 Interaction of Radiation with Matter Chap. 3 Solution 1. According to Table I.3 in Appendix II, N = 0.080 X 1024 for carbon. Then from Eq. (3.2), the total interaction rate is atI N AX = 2.6 X 10-24 x 5 X 108 x 0.080 X 1024 x 0.1 x 0.05 = 5.2 x 105 interactions/sec. [Ans.] It should be noted that the 10-24 in the cross-section cancels with the 1024 in atom density. This is the reason for writing atom densities in the form of a number x 1024 2. In 1 sec, I A = 5 X 108 x 0.1 = 5 x 107 neutrons strike the target. Of these, 5.2 x 105 interact. The probability that a neutron interacts in the target is there­ fore 5.2 x 105/5 X 107 = 1.04 X 10-2 Thus, only about 1 neutron in 100 has a collision while traversing the target. Example 3.2 There are only two absorption reactions-namely, radiative capture and fission-that can occur when 0.0253-e V neutronsl interact with 235U. The cross-sections for these reactions are 99 band 582 b, respectively. When a 0.0253-e V neutron is absorbed by 235U, what is the relative probability that fission will occur? Solution. Since ay and a f are proportional to the probabilities of radiative capture and fission, it follows that the probability of fission is a f / (a y + a f) = a f / a a = 582/681 = 85.5%. [Ans.] To return to Eq. (3.2), this can be written as Number of collisions per second (in entire target) = I Nat x AX, (3.6) where at has been introduced because this cross-section measures the probability that a collision of any type may occur. Since AX is the total volume of the target, it follows from Eq. (3.6) that the number of collisions per cm3/sec in the target, which is called the collision density F, is given by (3.7) The product of the atom density N and a cross-section, as in Eq. (3.7), occurs frequently in the equations of nuclear engineering; it is given the special symbol b and is called the macroscopic; cross-set;tiQn. III particular, the product Nat = bt is called the macroscopic total cross-section, N as = bs is called the macroscopic scattering cross-section, and so on. Since N and a have units of cm-3 and cm2, I For reasons explained in Section 3.6, neutron cross-sections are tabulated at an energy of 0.0253 e V.

(3.7) reduces to (3.8) Example 3.3 Referring to Example 3.1, calculate the (a) macroscopic total cross-section of 12C at Me V; (b) collision density in the target. Solution 1. From the definition given previously, bt = 0.08 X 1024 x 2.6 X 10-24 = 0.21 cm-l [Ans.] 2. Using Eq. (3.8) gives F = 5 X 108 x 0.21 = 1.05 x 108 collisions/cm 3-sec. [Ans.] These collisions occur, of course, only in the region of the target that is struck by the beam. 3.3 NEUTRON ATTENUATION The preceding section refers to experiments involving thin targets. Suppose a thick target of thickness X is placed in a monodirectional beam of intensity 10 and a neutron detector is located at some distance behind the target as shown in Fig. 3.2. It is assumed that both the target and detector are so small that the detector subtends a small solid angle at the target. For a neutron to reach the detector, it must be traveling directly toward both the target and detector. Consequently, every neutron that has a collision in the target is lost from the beam, and only those neutrons that do not interact enter the detector. Incident neutrons Scattered Uncollided neutrons Detector Figure 3.2 Measurement of neutrons that have not collided in a target.

page number: 76
 text: 58 Interaction of Radiation with Matter Chap. 3 Let I (x) be the intensity of the neutrons that have not collided after penetrat­ing the distance x into the target. Then in traversing an additional distance dx, the intensity of the uncollided beam is decreased by the number of neutrons that have collided in the thin sheet of target having an area of 1 cm2 and the thickness dx. From Eq. (3.2), this decrease in intensity is given by -d I (x) = Nat I (x) dx = L-t I (x) dx. (3.9) This equation can be integrated with the result I (x) = loe-Etx (3.10) The intensity of the uncollided neutrons thus decreases exponentially with the dis­tance inside the target. The intensity of the beam of uncollided neutrons emerging from the target is then (3.11) and this is the intensity measured by the detector. If the target is very thick, as with a radiation shield, then almost all of the incident neutrons will have at least one collision in the target, so that most of the emerging neutrons will have undergone scattering within the target. Since these neutrons are specifically excluded in the derivation ofEq. (3.11), this equation must not be used to calculate the effectiveness of a shield. To do so would ignore a most important component of the emergent radiation-namely, the scattered neutrons. When Eq. (3.9) is divided by I (x), the result is dl(x) ---= L-t dx. I(x) (3.12) Since the quantity d I (x) is equal to the number of neutrons out of a total of I (x) that collide in dx, it follows that d I (x) / I (x) is the probability that a neutron which survives up to x without a collision interacts in the next dx. Therefore, from Eq. (3.12), L-t dx is equal to the probability that a neutron will interact in dx, and it may be concluded that L-t is the probability per unit path length that a neutron will undergo some sort of a collision as it moves about in a medium. It should also be noted that, since I (x) refers to those neutrons that have not collided in penetrating the distance x, the ratio I(x)/Io = e-Etx is equal to the probability that a neutron can move through this distance without having a colli­sion. Now let the quantity p(x) dx be the probability that a neutron will have its first collision in dx in the neighborhood of x. This is evidently equal to the proba­bility that the neutron survives up to x without a collision times the probability that it does in faet eollide in the additional distance dx. Since L-t is the probability of interaction per path length, p(x) dx is given by

This quantity, which is designated by the symbol A, is equal to the average value of x, the distance traversed by a neutron without a collision. The value of A is obtained from the probability function p (x) by determining the average distance traveled, that is, A = 100 xp(x)dx = �t 100 xe-E,x dx (3.13) Example 3.4 Calculate the mean free path of 100-keV neutrons in liquid sodium. At this energy, the total cross-section of sodium is 3.4 b. Solution. From Table 11.3, the atom density of sodium is 0.0254 x 1024 The macro­ scopic cross-section is then bt = 0.0254 X 1024 x 3.4 X 10-24 = 0.0864 cm-l The mean free path is therefore A = 1/0.0864 = 11.6 cm [Ans.J Consider next a homogeneous mixture of 2 nuclear species, X and Y, con­taining Nx and Ny atoms/cm3 of each type, and let ax and ay be the cross-sections of the 2 nuclei for some particular interaction. The probability per unit path that a neutron collides with a nucleus of the first type is �x = N xax and with a nucleus of the second type is �y = Nyay. The total probability per unit path that a neutron interacts with either nucleus is therefore (3.14) If the nuclei are in atoms that are bound together in a molecule, Eq. (3.14) can be used to define an equivalent cross-section for the molecule. This is done simply by dividing the macroscopic cross-section of the mixture by the number of molecules per unit volume. For example, if there are N molecules XmYn per cm3, then Nx = mN, Ny = nN, and from Eq. (3.14) the cross-section for the molecule is � a = - = max + nay. N (3.15) Equations (3.14) and (3.15) are based on the assumption that the nuclei X and Y act independently of one another when they interact with neutrons. This

Low-energy scattering cross-sections for such substances must be obtained from experiment. Example 3.5 The absorption cross-section of 235U and 238U at 0.0253 e V are 680.8 band 2.70 b, respectively. CalculateI:a for natural uranium at this energy. Solution. By use of the methods of Section 2.14, the atom densities of 235U and 238U in natural uranium are found to be 3.48 x 10-4 x 1024 and 0.0483 x 1024, respectively. Then from Eq. (3.14) I:a = 3.48 X 10-4 x 680.8 + 0.0483 x 2.70 = 0.367 cm-1 [Ans.] Example 3.6 The scattering cross-sections (in barns) of hydrogen and oxygen at 1 Me V and 0.0253 e V are given in the following table. What are the values of as for the wa­ ter molecule at these energies? Solution. Equation (3.15) applies at 1 Me V, so that as(H20) = 2asCH) +as(O) = 2 x 3 + 8 = 14 b. [Ans.] Equation (3.15) does not apply at 0.0253, and as(H20) =I=- 2 x 21 + 4 = 46 b. The experimental value of as (H20) at 0.0253 eV is 103 b. [Ans.] 3.4 NEUTRON FLUX H o IMeV 3 8 0.0253 eV 21 4 It was shown in Section 3.2 that when a beam of neutrons of intensity I strikes a thin target, the number of collisions per cm3/sec is given by F = L.tI, (3.16) where L.t is the macroscopic total cross-section. Consider an experiment of the type shown in Fig. 3.3, in which a small target is exposed simultaneously to several neutron beams. The intensities of the beams are different, but it is assumed that the neutrons in all of the beams have the same energy. In view of the fact that the interaction of neutrons with nuclei is indepen­dent of the angle at which the neutrons collide with the nuclei, the total interaction rate is clearly F = L.t(IA + IE + Ie + .. ).

 text: Sec. 3.4 Neutron Flux :� --'[-ar-ge--: Figure 3.3 Neutron beams striking a target. 61 The neutrons have been assumed to be monoenergetic. So from Eg. (3.1), this may also be written as )v, (3.18) where n A, n B, and so on are the densities of the neutrons in the various beams and v is the neutron speed. Since n A + n B + nc + is equal to n, the total density of neutrons striking the target, Eq. (3.18) becomes (3.19) The situation at any point in a reactor is a generalization of this experiment, but with the neutrons moving in all directions. It follows that Eq. (3.19) is valid for a reactor, where n is the neutron density at the point where F is computed. The quantity n v in Eq. (3.19) is called the neutron flux, in this case for mo­noenergetic neutrons, and is given the symbol ¢; thus ¢ =nv. (3.20) It is evident that the units of neutron flux are the same as the units of beam intensity-namely, neutrons/cm2-sec. In tenus of the flux, the collision density is (3.21) To understand the importance of the flux and this relationship, consider the following example. Example 3.7 A certain research reactor has a flux of 1 x 1013 neutrons/cm 2-sec and a volume of 64,000 cm3 If the fission cross-section, :E[, in the reactor is 0.1 cm-1, what is the power of the reactor? Solution. The power may be obtained from the fission rate using the relationship between the energy released per fission (200 Me V) and the rate at which fissions are occuring:

(3.21), the fission rate is Fission rate = br<l> = 0.1 cm-I x 1 x 1013 neutrons/cm 2-sec. The reactor power/cm3 is then Power/cm3 = 3.2 x 10-17 MW/fission/sec x 1 x 1012 fission/sec-cm 3 The total power is the power/cm3 times the volume of the active core. Power = 3.2 x 10-5 MW/cm3 x 64,000 cm3 = 2 MW [Ans.] 3.5 NEUTRON CROSS·S ECTION DATA All neutron cross-sections are functions of the energy of the incident neutrons and the nature of the target nucleus. These factors must be taken into consideration in the choice of materials for use in nuclear devices. Most of the cross-section data needed for such purposes are found in the Brookhaven National Laboratory report BNL-325 and other source, which are discussed in the references at the end of the chapter. Before turning to the data, however, it is of interest to consider the mechanisms by which neutrons interact with nuclei. Compound Nucleus Formation Most neutron interactions proceed in 2 steps. The incident neutron, on striking the target nucleus, first coalesces with it to form a compound nucleus. If the target nucleus is A Z, the compound nucleus is A+l Z. The compound nucleus may then decay in a number of ways. Por example, when IO-Me V neutrons strike an 56Pe target, the compound nucleus is 57Pe, and this nucleus may decay by emitting an elastic or inelastic neutron, a y-ray, or two neutrons. In symbols, th€S€ proc€sses are 56Pe + n (elastic scattering) 56 57 *� 56Fe + n' (inelastic scattering) Fe + n ---+ ( Fe) . . 57Pe + y (radIatIve capture) 55Pe + 2n (n, 2n reaction).

 text: Sec. 3.5 Neutron Cross-Section Data 63 One of the striking features of interactions that proceed by way of compound nucleus formation is that their cross-sections exhibit maxima at certain incident neutron energies. Such maxima are called resonances and arise in the following way. It is recalled from Section 2.7 that nuclei have various excited states corre­sponding to different configurations of nucleons in the nucleus. It turns out that the incident neutron and target nucleus are more likely to combine and form a com­pound nucleus if the energy of the neutron is such that the compound nucleus is produced in one of its excited states. The resonances show up in the cross-section because it is necessary to form the compound nucleus before the interaction can proceed. It is recalled from Section 2.11 that it takes energy-namely, the neutron separation energy-to remove a neutron from a nucleus. This separation energy reappears, however, when the neutron reenters the nucleus. Therefore, it follows that when a neutron collides with a nucleus, the compound nucleus is formed in an excited state having an energy equal to the kinetic energy of the incident neu­tron plus the separation energy or binding energy of the neutron in the compound nucleus.2 Elastic Scattering The elastic scattering cross-section as a function of the energy of the incident neutron can be divided into three distinct regions. In the first, low-energy region, rre is approximately constant. The scattering in this region does not occur by compound nucleus formation, but merely because of the forces exerted by the target nucleus on the passing neutron. The cross-section for this potential scattering is given by rre (potential scattering) = 4n R2 , (3.22) where R is the nuclear radius. Beyond the potential scattering region, there is a region of resonances that is due to compound nucleus formation. At still higher energies, the resonances crowd together to such an extent that the individual resonances can no longer be resolved; in this region, rre is a smooth and slowly varying function of energy. Figure 3.4 shows these three regions for the target nucleus carbon. Carbon is a relatively light nucleus. With heavier nuclei, the region of resonances is found at lower energies. For example, the resonance region of 238U begins at only 6 e V and ends at roughly 1 ke V. Example 3.8 Using experimental elastic scattering data, estimate the radius of the C nucleus. 2This discussion is somewhat simplified, center-of-mass effects having been ignored. For a more complete discussion, see Introduction to Nuclear Reactor Theory, noted in the references.

From Fig. 3.4, it is observed that ae has the constant value of 4.8 b from about 0.02 eV to 0.01 Me V. This is due to potential scattering. Then from Eq. (3.22), 41l'R2 = 4.8 X 10-24 and R = 6.2 X 10-13 cm. [Ans.] Inelastic Scattering This process does not occur unless the neutron has sufficient energy to place the target nucleus in its first excited state.3 As a result, ai is zero up to some threshold energy. Generally speaking, the energy at which the first excited state is found decreases with increasing mass number. As a conse­quence, ai is nonzero over a larger energy region for the heavier nuclei than for the lighter nuclei. The threshold for inelastic scattering is 4.80 Me V for C, whereas it is only 44 keY for 238U. At energies well above threshold, ai is roughly equal to as. Radiative Capture As in the case of elastic scattering, it is convenient to divide the radiative capture cross-section into three regions. In the low-energy 3Because of center-of-mass effects, the threshold energy for inelastic scattering is actually somewhat higher than the energy of the first excited state. Except for the very light nuclei, however, this can be ignored.

Since the neutron speed v is proportional to y'E, this means that ay varies as 1/v. The low­energy region of ay is therefore known as the l/v region. Neutron cross-sections are often plotted on a log-log scale, and a cross-section that is 1/ v then appears as a straight line with a slope of -1/2. This can be seen in Fig. 3.5, in which the 1/v region and the first resonance are shown for 197 Au. For a few important nuclei, cry does not show exact 1/v behavior at low energy, and such nuclei are called non-1/v absorbers. Above the 1/v region, there is a region of resonances that occurs at the same energies as the resonances in as. Near an isolated resonance at the energy Er, ay is given by the Breit-Wigner one-level fonnula: Yr2g rnrg a - ------ � ---y -4Jr (E - Er)� + r2/4 .

It is easy to show that a y falls to one half of its maximum value at the energies

Above the resonances region, which ends at about 1 keVin the heavy nuclei and at increasingly higher energies in lighter nuclei, O"y drops rapidly and smoothly to very small values. Charged-Particle Reactions As a rule, the (n, p), (n, a), and other charged-particle reactions are endothermic and do not occur below some threshold energy. Their cross-sections also tend to be small, even above threshold, especially for the heavier nuclei. However, there are some important exothermic reactions in light nuclei. One of these is the reaction lOB(n, a)7Li, the cross-section of which is shown in Fig. 3.6. It is observed that O"a is very large at low energy; for this reason, lOB is often used to absorb low-energy neutrons. It should also be noted in Fig. 3.6 that O"a is 1/v over several orders of magnitude in energy. A similar exothermic reaction that also shows a strong 1/v behavior is 6Li(n, a)3H. This reaction is used for the production of tritium, 3H. Some endothermic charged-particle reactions are important in reactors even though their thresholds are high.

 text: Sec. 3.5 Neutron Cross-Section Data 67 reaction is the principal source of the radioactivity of the water (the 16N under­goes �-decay, with a half-life of approximately 7 secs, which is accompanied by the emission of 6-to 7-Me V y-rays), despite that ordinarily only one neutron in several thousand has an energy greater than the 9-Me V threshold for this reaction. Total Cross-Sec tion Since at is the sum of all the other cross-sections, the variation of at with energy reflects the behavior of the individual component cross-sections. In particular, at low energy, at behaves as 2 C at = 4rr R + ,..fE' (3.24) where C is a constant. The first tenn in this expression is the cross-section for elastic scattering; the second tenn gives the cross-section for radiative capture or whatever other exothennic reaction is possible at this energy. If the first tenn in Eq. (3.24) is much larger than the second, then at is a constant at low energy; if the second tenn dominates, at is lIv in this energy region. In the resonance region, at exhibits the resonances found in as and aj, all of which occur at the same energies in each of these cross-sections. At higher energies above the resonance region, at becomes a smooth and rolling function of energy, as shown in Fig. 3.4. Hydrogen and Deuterium The nuclei 1 Hand 2H, which are present in large amounts in many nuclear reactors, interact with neutrons in a somewhat different manner from other nuclei. For one thing, interactions with 1 Hand 2H do not involve the fonnation of a compound nucleus. They also do not have any resonances. The cross-section, as, is constant up to 10 KeV, and ay is l/v at all energies. Furthennore, these nuclei have no excited states e H is, after all, only a single proton), and so inelastic scattering does not occur. Example 3.9 The value of O"y for 1 Hat 0.0253 eV is 0.332 b. What is O"y at 1 eV? Solution. Since O"y is 1/v, it can be written as O"y (E) = O"y (Eo) !Eo 'IE' where Eo is any energy. In this problem, O"y is known as 0.0253 eV and so it is reasonable to take this to be the value of Eo. Then )0.0253 O"y (Ie V) = 0.332 x -1- = 0.0528 b. [Ans.]

The kinetic energy of the scattered neutron is there­fore smaller than the energy of the incident neutron by an amount equal to the energy acquired by the recoiling nucleus. In this way, neutrons lose energy in elas­tic collisions even though the internal energy of the nucleus does not change. The energy loss in elastic scattering can be found from the laws of conser­vation of energy and momentum. Let E, p and E', p' be the kinetic energy and (vector) momentum of the neutron before and after the collision, respectively, and let E A and P be the energy and momentum of the recoiling nucleus. The neutron is scattered at the angle iJ; the nucleus recoils at the angle ({J (see Fig. 3.7). In view of the fact that the collision is elastic, it follows that E = E' + EA. (3.25) The conservation of momentum, namely, p=p' +P, can be depicted by the vector diagram shown in Fig. 3.8. Then by the law of cosines, p2 = p2 + (p')2 _ 2pp' cos iJ. p ...

 text: Sec. 3.6 Energy Loss in Scattering Collisions 69 From classical mechanics, p2 = 2M E A, p2 = 2m E, and p,2 = 2m E', where M and m are the masses of the nucleus and neutron, respectively. Equation (3.26) can then be written as MEA = mE + mE' -2m-JEE' cos iJ. (3.27) Since M / m is approximately equal to A, the atomic mass number of the nucleus, Eq. (3.27) is equivalent to AEA = E + E' -2-J EE' cos iJ. Next, introducing EA from Eq. (3.25) gives, when arranged, (A + l)E' -2-JEE' cos iJ -(A -1)E = O. This equation is quadratic in y'Ei and has the solution E' = E 2 [cos iJ + j A 2 _ sin2 iJ] 2 (A + 1) (3.28) It is of some interest to consider the consequences of Eq. (3.28). In a grazing collision, iJ is approximately equal to zero, and Eq. (3.28) gives E' = E. As would be expected, there is no energy loss in such a collision. Except for the special case of hydrogen, which must be considered separately, it follows from Eq. (3.28) that the minimum value of E', (E')min, occurs when iJ = JT. The neutron is then scattered directly backward and suffers the largest possible loss in energy. For iJ = JT, Eq. (3.28) gives where (A -1)2 (E')min = --E = exE, A+ 1 a= e��r is called the collision parameter. Values of ex are given in Table 3.1. (3.29) (3.30) The scattering of neutrons by hydrogen is unique because the masses of the neutron and hydrogen nucleus (proton) are essentially equal. It is not difficult to show from classical mechanics, and, indeed, it is a common observation, that a particle striking another particle of the same mass, which is initially at rest, cannot be scattered through an angle greater than 90° The minimum energy of neutrons scattered from hydrogen must therefore be found by placing iJ = JT /2 in Eq. (3.28), and this gives (E')min = O.

Since this result could have also been obtained by placing A (3.29), it may be concluded that (E')min = aE is valid for all nuclei, including hydrogen. Chap. 3 1 in Eq. (3.31) It is also of interest to know the average energy of an elastically scattered neutron. This computation is more difficult than that of maximum and minimum energies and is not given here. It can be shown, however, that for scattering by light nuclei, including hydrogen, and at most of the neutron energies of interest in nuclear reactors, the average energy of the scattered neutron is given approximately by E' = i(1 + a)E. The average energy loss, �E then �E = E - E' = i(1 -a)E , and the average fractional energy loss is �E 1 - = 2(1-a). E (3.32) This equation is also valid for the heavier nuclei, but not for high-energy neutrons. With 238U, for example, Eq. (3.32) is not accurate much above an energy of 100 ke V. At higher energies, the energy loss in collisions with the heavier nuclei is less than that predicted by Eq. (3.32).

 text: Sec. 3.6 Energy Loss in Scattering Collisions 71 From Eq. (3.30) and Table 3.1, it is observed that ex is zero for A = 1 (hy­drogen) and increases monotonically to unity with increasing A. In view of Eq. (3.30), it follows that the average fractional energy loss decreases from � in the case of hydrogen to almost zero for the heavy nuclei. Thus, on the average, a neu­tron loses one-half of its energy in a collision with hydrogen. When scattered by carbon, since ex = 0.716, it loses about 14% of its energy, while in a collision with uranium, ex = 0.983, a neutron loses less than 1 % of its energy. In short, neutrons lose less and less energy the heavier the target nucleus is. It is often necessary to slow down fast neutrons-a process known as moderation. From the foregoing discussion, it is clear that materials of low mass number are most effective for this purpose since the neutrons slow down most rapidly in such media. Neutrons also lose energy through inelastic collisions, as a result of both re­coil and internal excitation of the target nucleus. Since the threshold energy for in­elastic scattering is so high in light nuclei (usually on the order of several Me V-it does not occur at all in hydrogen), moderation by inelastic scattering is less im­portant than by elastic scattering in these nuclei. With the heavier nuclei, however, the inelastic threshold is much lower, and inelastic scattering is often the principal mechanism for neutron moderation. In many reactor calculations, especially in connection with neutron modera­tion, it is convenient to describe neutron collisions in terms of a new variable called lethargy. This quantity is denoted by the symbol u and is defined as u = In(EMI E), (3.33) where EM is an arbitrary energy-usually that of the highest energy neutron in the system. From Eq. (3.33), it should be noted that, at high energy, a neutron's lethargy is low; as it slows down and E decreases, its lethargy increases. The average change in lethargy in an elastic collision, /)"u, like the average fractional energy loss [see Eq. (3.32)], is independent of the energy of the incident neutron. The quantity /)"u appears in many nuclear engineering calculations and is denoted by the symbol �. By a derivation that is too lengthy to be given here, it can be shown that � is given by (A_l)2 (A+l) �=l-In --2A A-I' (3.34) where A is the mass number of the target nucleus. Except for small values of A, � is well approximated by the simple formula 2 �::::'--2' A+3 (3.35) Even for A = 2, Eq. (3.35) is off by only about 3%. Exact values of � are given in Table 3.1.

 text: 72 Interaction of Radiation with Matter Chap. 3 Example 3.10 A I-Me V neutron is scattered through an angle of 45° in a collision with a 2H nu­ cleus. (a) What is the energy of the scattered neutron? (b) What is the energy of the recoiling nucleus? (c) How much of a change in lethargy does the neutron undergo in this collision? Solution 1. Substituting E = 1 Me V, A = 2, and 11 = 45° into Eq. (3.28) gives immedi­ ately E' = 0.738 Me V. [Ans.] 2. Since the collision is elastic (inelastic scattering does not occur with 2H), the recoil energy is EA = 1.000 -0.738 = 0.262 Me V. [Ans.] 3. The lethargy going into the collision is u = In(EM / E) and coming out is u' = In(EM / E'). The change in lethargy is therefore D.u = u' - u = In(E / E') - In(1/0.738) = 0.304 (a unitless number). [Ans.] Polyenerge tic Neutrons In Sections 3.2 and 3.3, the rate at which neu­trons undergo collision in a target was calculated on the assumption that the inci­dent neutrons were monoenergetic. This can easily be generalized to neutrons that are not monoenergetic, but have a distribution in energy. For this purpose, let nee) dE be the number of neutrons per cm3 with en­ergies between E and E + dE in a neutron beam incident on a thin target. The intensity of these neutrons is d I (E) = n(E)v(E) dE, (3.36) where vee) is the speed corresponding to the energy E. According to Eq. (3.8), this beam interacts in the target at a rate of dF(E) = n(E)v(E)"Et(E) dE collisions per cm3/sec, where "Et(E) is the macroscopic total cross-section. The collision density is then F = f n(E)v(E)"E,(E) dE, (3.37) in which the integration is carried over all energies in the beam. To compute the interaction rate for a particular type of interaction, it is merely necessary to replace "Et (E) in Eq. (3.37) by the appropriate cross-section. An es­pecially important case is the absorption of thermal neutrons-that is, neutrons whose energies are distributed according to the Maxwellian function described in Section 2.13. These neutrons are found in certain types of nuclear reactors called thermal reactors, which are discussed in Chapters 4 and 6. The absorption rate in

page number: 91
 text: Sec. 3.6 Energy Loss in Scattering Collisions 73 a beam of thermal neutrons is Fa = f n(E)v(E)'Ea(E) dE, (3.38) where La (E) is the macroscopic absorption cross-section and the integral is eval­uated at thermal energies up to about 0.1 e V. In Section 3.5, it was pointed out that at low energies most nuclei exhibit 1/ v absorption, either as the result of radiative capture or some other absorption reaction. At these energies, La (E) can be written as (3.39) where Eo is an arbitrary energy and Vo is the corresponding speed. When Eq. (3.39) is introduced into Eq. (3.38), the veE) cancels so that Fa = 'Ea(Eo)vo f n(E)dE. (3.40) The remaining integral is equal to the total density of thermal neutron, n, and Eq. (3.40) reduces to (3.41) Equation (3.41) shows that for a l/v absorber, the absorption rate is inde­pendent of the energy distribution of the neutrons and is determined by the cross­section at an arbitrary energy. Furthermore, it may be concluded from Eq. (3.41) that, although the neutrons have a distribution of energies, the absorption rate is the same as that for a monoenergetic beam of neutrons with arbitrary energy Eo and intensity n Vo. In view of these results, it has become standard practice to specify all absorp­tion cross-sections lIv or not, at the single energy of Eo = 0.0253 e V. The corre­sponding speed is Vo = 2,200 meters/sec. Values of cross-sections at 0.0253 e V are loosely referred to as thermal cross-sections. These are tabulated in a number of places, including the chart of nuclides; an abridged table is found in Appendix II. This quantity nvo in Eq. (3.41) is called 2,200 meters-per-second flux and is denoted by 4>0; that is 4>0 = nvo· (3.42) The absorption rate is then simply (3.43)

 text: 74 Interaction of Radiation with Matter Chap. 3 Although only a comparatively few nuclei are non-l/v absorbers, these nuclei are usually important in nuclear systems since their cross-sections tend to be rather high. The absorption rate for such nuclei is again given by Eq. (3.38), but now the integral cannot be simplified as it was in the 1/v case. In particular, Fa now depends on the function neE) as well as �a(E). However, by assuming that neE) is the Maxwellian function, C. H. Westcott computed Fa numerically for all of the important non-1/ v absorbers. The resulting value of Fa is a function of the temperature of the neutron distribution and is given in the form (3.44) where ga(T), which is called the non-l/v factor, is a tabulated function and �a (Eo) is again the absorption cross-section at 0.0253 e V. A short table of non-1/v factors is given in Table 3.2. Although the prior results were derived for a beam of neutrons incident on a thin target, they apply equally well to the more complicated situation found in many nuclear systems in which the neutrons are moving in all directions. In particular, the 2,200 meters-per-second flux is defined at any point where there are n thermal neutrons per cm3, and Eq. (3.43) or (3.44) can be used to compute the absorption rate at such a point. Example 3.11 A small indium foil is placed at a point in a reactor where the 2,200 meters-per­ second flux is 5 X 1012 neutrons/cm 2-sec. The neutron density can be represented by a Maxwellian function with a temperature of 600°C. At what rate are the neutrons absorbed per cm3 in the foil? Solution. From Table 11.3 in Appendix II, N = 0.0383 X 1024 and aa(Eo) = 194 b so that ba(Eo) = 0.0383 x 194 = 7.43 cm-I However, indium is non-l/v and from Table 3.2, ga(600°C) = 1.15. From Eq. (3.44), it follows that Fa = 1.15 x 7.43 x 5 X 1012 = 4.27 X 1013neutrons/cm 3-sec. [Ans.] 3.7 FISSION It was shown in Section 2.11 that the binding energies of nuclei per nucleon de­crease with increasing atomic mass number, for A greater than about 50. This means that a more stable configuration of nucleons is obtained whenever a heavy nucleus splits into two parts-that is, undergoes fission. The heavier, more unsta­ble nuclei might therefore be expected to fission spontaneously without external intervention. Such fissions do occur. It is interesting to examine the origin of the decrease in the binding energy per nucleon with increasing A. Figure 3.9 shows the terms in the binding energy per

The decrease in binding energy per nucleon is largely due to the coulomb tenn overcoming the volume tenn. The volume tenn represents the binding due to the strong nuclear forces. It is the coulomb repulsion, then, that is largely responsible for fission. Although heavy nuclei do spontaneously fission, they do so only rarely. For fission to occur rapidly enough to be useful in nuclear reactors, it is necessary to supply energy to the nucleus. This, in tum, is due to the fact that there are attractive forces acting between the nucleons in a nucleus, and energy is required to defonn the nucleus to a point where the system can begin to split in two. This energy is called the critical energy a/fission and is denoted by Ecrit. Values of Ecrit are given in Table 3.3 for several nuclei. Any method by which energy Ecrit is introduced into a nucleus, thereby caus­ing it to fission, is said to have induced the fission. The most important of these is neutron absorption. It is recalled from Sections 2.11 and 3.5 that when a neutron is absorbed the resulting compound nucleus is fonned in an excited state at an en­ergy equal to the kinetic energy of the incident neutron plus the separation energy or binding energy of the neutron in the compound nucleus. If this binding energy alone is greater than the critical energy for fission of the compound nucleus, then fission can occur with neutrons having essentially no kinetic energy. For example, according to Table 3.3, the binding energy of the last neutron in 236U is 6.4 Me V,

Thus, when a neutron of zero kinetic energy is absorbed by 235U, the compound nucleus, 236U, is produced with 1.1 Me V more energy than its critical energy, and fission can immediately occur. Nuclei such as 235U, that lead to fission following the absorption of a zero-energy neutron, are called fissile. Note, however, that although it is the 235U that is said to be fissile, the nucleus that actually fissions in this case is the 236U. From Table 3.3 it is evident that 233U and 239pu (plutonium-239) are also fissile. In addition, 241 Pu and several other nuclei not indicated in the table are also fissile. With most heavy nuclei other than 233U, 235U, 239pu, and 241 Pu, the binding energy of the incident neutron is not sufficient to supply the compound nucleus with the critical energy, and the neutron must have some kinetic energy to induce fission. In particular, this is always the case when the struck nucleus contains an even number of nucleons since the binding energy of the incident neutron to an even-A nucleus is always less than to an odd-A nucleus. (This odd-even variation in binding energy is evident in Table 3.3.) For instance, the binding energy of the last neutron in 239U is only 4.9 Me V, and this is the excitation of the compound nucleus formed when a neutron of zero kinetic energy is absorbed by 238U. Since Ecrit for 239U is 5.5 Me V, it is clear that fission cannot occur unless the neutron incident on the 238U has an energy greater than about 0.6 Me V. Nuclei such as 238U, which do not fission unless struck by an energetic neutron, are said to be fissionable but non fissile . For reasons that are clear later in this book, the non fissile isotopes such as 238U cannot alone be used to fuel nuclear reactors, and it is the fissile isotopes, especially 235U and 239pu, that are the practical fuels of nuclear power. The semi-empirical mass formula discussed in Chapter 2 may be used to ex­amine the dependence of the critical energy given in Table 3.3. For the case of 235U,

page number: 96
 text: 78 Interaction of Radiation with Matter Chap. 3 the critical energy is obtained by calculating the Q-value for the reaction using the semi-empirical mass fonnula. The origin of the variation in critical energy is evi­dent by comparing the value of the odd-even tenn as A is increased from 233 to 238. Fission Cross-Sec tions The cross-sections of fissile nuclei for neutron­induced fission resemble radiative capture cross-sections in their dependence on the energy of the incident neutron. Thus, as seen in Fig. 3.10, where OJ is given for 235U, there are three distinct regions to the cross-section. At low energy, OJ is l/v or nearly so; this is followed by a region of resonances; finally, above the resonance region, a f is smooth and rolling. It should be noted that a f is especially large in the l/v region. The fission cross-sections of fissionable but nonfissile nuclei, by contrast, are zero up to a threshold energy, which always occurs above the resonance region. As a result, a f is relatively smooth at all energies. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.11, where a f is shown for 238U. � e c 0 .� u C!)

(Plotted using ENDFIB 6 and ENDFPLOT over the Internet from Korean Atomic En­ ergy Research Institute.) 81 16 It should not be implied from the foregoing discussion that, when a neutron collides with a fissile nucleus, or with a fissionable but nonfissile nucleus above the fission threshold, the result is always fission. This is not the case; neutrons in­teracting with these nuclei may be scattered, elastically or inelastically, they may be absorbed in radiative capture, and so on. The cross-sections for all of these processes have been measured and are found in ENDFIB 6. However, with fissile nuclei at low energies, only three interactions are possible: elastic scattering, radia­tive capture, and, of course, fission. The value of as is much smaller than either a y or a f' so that radiative capture and fission are by far the more probable events. The ratio of the cross-sections of these two processes is called the capture-to-fission ratio and is denoted by the symbol a, that is, ay a= ­ af (3.45) This parameter, which is a function of energy, has an important bearing on the design of many reactors.

In fact, such symmetric fission is a rare event. Fission is almost always asymmetric, so that the masses of the two fragments are substantially different. This is indicated in Fig. 3.12, where the fission-product yield, that is, the percent of the fission fragments produced with a given mass num­ber, is shown as a function of A for fission induced by thermal neutrons in 235U. It should be noted that the figure is plotted on the logarithmic scale so that the fission­product distribution is more strongly asymmetric than it would at first appear. With the increasing energy of the incident neutron, fission becomes more symmetric. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.12 by the yield of fission products arising from fission induced by 14 Me V neutrons. 10�--�--�----�--�� � -d' 0.1 "0 ';;' c:: .� 0.01 tE 0.00 1 0.000 1 LL-.--'------'------'----' __ -'-----'-----I-----I. -----' 70 90 llO 130 150 Mass number Figure 3.12 Fission-product yields for thermal and 14-MeV fission neutrons in U-235.

 text: Sec. 3.7 Fission 83 When the fission products are initially fonned, they are excessively neutron rich; they contain more neutrons than are necessary for their stability. As a result, they decay by emitting a sequence of negative fJ-rays, which are accompanied by various y-rays. For example, the isotope 115Pd (palladium-I 15) is produced di­rectly in fission and decays by the chain 115Pd � 115 Ag � 115Cd � 115In (stable). Many fission-product decay chains of this kind have been identified and can be deduced from the data on the chart of the nuclides. The radioactivity of the fission products is the cause of a number of problems in the utilization of nuclear energy. For one thing, fission products accumulate in an operating reactor as the fuel undergoes fission, and elaborate precautions must be taken to ensure that they do not escape to the surrounding environment. Further­more, the heat released by decaying fission products may be so great that a reactor must be cooled after shutdown to prevent damage to the fuel. The continuing emis­sion of radiation from the fission products also tends to make parts of a reactor highly radioactive. When removed from a reactor, these parts must be cooled while being stored prior to disposal or processing. The quantitative aspects of fission-product decay are complicated by the fact that hundreds of different radioactive nuclides are produced in fission, each with its own characteristic half-life and decay radiation. For many purposes, however, the following expressions may be used to represent approximately the overall decay of the fission products. Thus, the rates at which fJ-rays and y-rays are emitted in the time interval from about 10 seconds to several weeks after a single fission are given by Rate of emission of fJ-rays ::: 3.8 x 10-6t-1.2 fJ-rays/sec, Rate of emission of y-rays ::: 1.9 x 10-6t-1.2y-rays/sec, where t is the time after fission in days. (3.46) (3.47) To express the prior disintegration rates in units of curies, it is merely neces­sary to note that each fJ-ray originates in the decay of a nuclide. Then since I Ci = 3.7 x 101Odisintegrations/sec, the fission-product activity t days after I fission is Fission product activity::: 3.8 x 1 0-6t-1.2 /3. 7 x lOw = 1.03 x 10-16t-1.2 Ci. (3.48) It is often necessary to calculate the total fission-product activity that accu­mulates in the fissile fuel of an operating reactor. Suppose, for example, that the reactor has been operating at a constant power of P megawatts (MW) for T days and is then shut down. To detennine the activity of the fission products t days after

Chap. 3 shutdown, it is necessary to integrate Eq. (3.48) over the appropriate time span. Let s be the interval in days from the time when a fission occurs to the time that the activity of its fission fragments is measured (see Fig. 3.13). It is shown later in this section that at a power level of P MW the total fission rate is 2.7 x 1021 P fissions per day. The number of fissions occurring in time ds is then 2.7 x 1021 Pds fissions. From Eq. (3.48), the activity s days later is 2.7 x 1021 Pds x 1.03 x 10-16S-1.2 = 0.28 X 106 Ps-1.2 ds Ci. The total activity at t is then jt+T Fission product activity = 0.28 x 106 P t s-1.2 ds = 1.4 X 106 p[t-O.2 -(t + T)-O.2] Ci. (3.49) The prior equations may be used to compute the activity of a single fuel rod that has been left in a reactor for t days and then removed. In this case, P is the power produced by the fuel rod in megawatts and t is the time in days since its removal from the reactor. It is somewhat more difficult to analytically calculate the total energy re­leased by fission products since, for one thing, the energy spectrum of the emitted radiation changes in time as these nuclides decay. For rough estimates, the average energies of the f3-and y-rays are sometimes taken to be 0.4 Me V and 0.7 Me V, re­spectively. The rate of energy release from the decaying fission products following one fission is then Decay energy rate � 2.8 x 10-6t-1.2Me V/sec, (3.50) where t is again in days. However, a far better procedure is to use actual experi­mental data on energy release. This method is discussed in detail in Chapter 8 (see Section 8.1). Example 3.12 The total initial fuel loading of a particular reactor consists of 120 fuel rods. After the reactor has been operated at a steady power of 100 MW for 1 year, the fuel is

(3.49), P = 100, t = 1, and t + T = 1 + 365 = 366. The activity of all fuel rods 1 day after removal is then 1.4 X 106 x 100 X [(1)-0.2 -(366)-0.2] = 1.4 x 108(1 -0.307) = 9.7 x 107 Ci. One rod would have an activity of 9.7 X 107/120 = 8.1 x 105 Ci. [Ans.] Fission Neutrons Most of the neutrons released in fission (usually more than 99%) are emitted essentially at the instant of fission. These are called prompt neutrons, in contrast to delayed neutrons, which are released comparatively long after the fission event. The average number of neutrons, both prompt and delayed, released per fis­sion is given the symbol v. Values of v for fission induced by O.0253-e V neutrons are given in Table 3.4. As the energy of the incident neutron is raised, v increases slowly. One additional neutron is emitted for every 6-to 7-Me V increase in neutron energy. For later use in reactor calculations, it is convenient to define the parameter 1}, which is equal to the number of neutrons released in fission per neutron absorbed by a fissile nucleus. Since radiative capture competes with fission, 1} is always smaller than v. In particular, 1} is equal to v multiplied by the relative probability (a f jaa) that an absorption leads to fission (see Example 3.2) or af af 1} = v-= v-.........:.....-aa ay + a f (3.51) In terms of a, the capture-to-fission ratio (see Eq. 3.45), this can be written as v 1}= l+a· (3.52) For a mixture of fissile or fissile and nonfissile nuclides, 1} is defined as the average number of neutrons emitted per neutron absorbed in the mixture. In this case, 1} is given by 1 1} = -L v(i)�f(i), �a i (3.53) where v(i) and � f(i) are the value of v and the macroscopic fission cross-section for the ith nuclide, respectively, and �a is the macroscopic cross-section for the mixture. It should be noted that v(i), � f(i) and �a in Eq. (3.53) must be computed at the energy of the neutrons inducing the fission. For example, if the fuel is a

 text: 86 Interaction of Radiation with Matter Chap. 3 mixture of 235U and 238U and the fissions are induced by low-energy neutrons, then v (235) L 1 (235) TJ = La (235) + La (238) (3.54) There are no tenns involving 238U in the numerator because this nuclide does not fission with low-energy neutrons. However, if this same fuel were used in a fast reactor (see Section 4.2), in which the fissions are induced by highly energetic neutrons, TJ would be v(235) L 1(235) + v(238) L 1(238) TJ = La (235) + La (238) . In this expression, all quantities are computed at the elevated energies. Example 3.13 Calculate the value of TJ for natural uranium at 0.0253 e V. Solution. Written out in detail, Eq. (3.54) is v(235)!V(235)aj(235) TJ = !V(235)aa(235) + !V (238)aa (238) (3.55) According to Eq. (2.61), the atom density of an isotope is proportional to its isotopic abundance y, so that v(235)y(235)aj(235) TJ = ------- =--- ---y (235)aa (235) + y (238)aa (238) Introducing data from Table 3.4 and Table 11.2 of Appendix II gives 2.418 x 0.72 x 582.2 TJ = = 1.34. [Ans.J 0.72 x 680.8 + 99.26 x 2.70 [!Vote: For reasons discussed in Chap. 6, this is not precisely the value used in reactor problems involving natural uranium; see Example 6.11.] The prompt fission neutrons are emitted with the continuous energy spectrum shown in Fig. 3.14. This spectrum is well described by the function X (E) = 0.453e-1.036E sinh J2.29E, (3.56) where X (E) is defined so that X (E) dE is the fraction of the prompt neutrons with energies between E and E +d E and E is in Me V. The function X (E) is nonnalized so that [0 X(E)dE = 1.

Although delayed neutrons ordinarily comprise less than 1 % of the neutrons released in fission, they play an important role in the control of nuclear reactors, as is seen in Chapter 7. These neutrons originate in the decay by neutron emission of nuclei produced in the ,B-decay of certain fission products. For example, when the fission-product 87Br decays to 87Kr, the latter may be formed in an excited state. In this case, the least bound neutron in the 87Kr is not bound at all and is ejected from the nucleus with an energy of about 0.3 Me V. This neutron is emitted as soon as the excited state is formed. Therefore, it appears to be emitted with the 54.5-sec half-life of the 87Br. Nuclei such as 87Br are called delayed-neutron precursors. There are believed to be about 20 such precursors, most of which have now been positively identified. The precursors can be divided into 6 groups, each with its own characteristic half­life. The group half-lives and decay constants are given in Table 3.5 for low-energy (thermal) fission in 235U. Also included in the table are the observed yields (neu­trons per fission) of the delayed neutrons in each group, together with the delayed­neutron fractions f3i. The quantity ,Bi is defined as the fraction of all of the fission neutrons released in fission that appear as delayed neutrons in the ith group. In other words, ,Bi is the absolute neutron yield of the i th group divided by v. The total delayed fraction ,B is the sum of all the ,Bi.

R. Keepin, Physics of Nuclear Kinetics, Reading, Mass.: Addison-W esley, 1965. Prompt ,-Rays At the instant of fission, a number of y-rays are emitted from the fissioning nucleus. These are referred to as prompt y-rays to distinguish them from the fission-product y-rays. The energy spectrum of the prompt y-rays is approximately the same as the spectrum of the fission-product y-rays. The Energy Released in Fission In discussing the energy of fission, it is important to distinguish between the total energy released in the process and the energy that can be recovered in a reactor and is therefore available for the production of heat. The recoverable energy and the total energy, in general, are different. This is illustrated in Table 3.6, which gives a breakdown of the component energies as they occur in the neutron-induced fission of 235U.

page number: 107
 text: Sec. 3.7 Fission 89 As indicated in the table, most (almost 85%) of the energy released in fission appears as the kinetic energy of the fission fragments. These fragments come to rest within about 10-3cm of the fission site so that all of their energy is converted into heat. The energies of the fission-product f3-rays and y-rays, the prompt and delayed neutrons, and the prompt y-rays are also recoverable since almost none of these radiations ever escape from a nuclear power system. However, the neutrinos that accompany f3-decay interact only slightly with matter and escape completely from every nuclear device. Their energy of almost 12 Me V per fission is therefore irrevocably lost for practical purposes. Because most fission neutrons remain within the confines of a reactor, these neutrons are eventually captured by the nuclei in the system. It is shown in the next chapter, however, that one of the v-neutrons emitted per fission must be absorbed by a fissionable nucleus and produce another fission in order for a nuclear reactor to remain in operation. Therefore, it follows that the remaining (v -1) neutrons per fission must be absorbed parasitically in the reactor, that is, absorbed in a nonfission reaction. Each absorption usually leads to the production of one or more capture y-rays, whose energies depend on the binding energy of the neutron to the com­pound nucleus. Since v is approximately 2.42 for 235U (its precise value depends on the energy of the neutrons causing the fission), this means that, from about 3 to 12 Me V of capture, y-radiation is produced per fission depending on the materials used in the reactor. All this y-ray energy is, of course, recoverable. It is observed in Table 3.6 that the energy of the capture y-rays compensates to some extent for the energy lost by neutrino emission. In any case, the recoverable energy per fission is approximately 200 Me V. In the absence of more accurate data, this is the value that is normally used at least in preliminary calculations. Consider now a reactor in which the energy from the fission 235U is released at the rate of P megawatts. In other words, the reactor is operating at a thermal power of P megawatts. With a recoverable energy per fission of 200 Me V, the rate at which fissions occur per second in the entire reactor is . 106 joules fission FIssion rate = P MW x x ----MW-sec 200 Me V MeV x x 1.60 X 10-13 joule 86,400 sec day = 2.70 x 1021 P fissions/day. To convert this to grams per day fissioned, which is also called the burnup rate, it is merely necessary to divide by Avogadro's number and multiply by 235.0, the gram atomic weight of 235U. This gives simply Bumup rate = 1.05P g/day. (3.57)

page number: 108
 text: 90 Interaction of Radiation with Matter Chap. 3 Thus, if the reactor is operating at a power of 1 MW, the 235U undergoes fission at the rate of approximately 1 g/day. To put this another way, the release of 1 megawatt/day of energy requires the fission of 1 g of 235U. It must be remembered, however, that fissile nuclei are consumed both in fission and radiative capture. Since the total absorption rate is (fa/(f! = (1 + a) times the fission rate, it follows from Eq. (3.57) that 235U is consumed at the rate of Consumption rate = 1.05(1 + a)P g/day. (3.58) For 235U, the thennal value of a is 0.169. Equation (3.58) shows that this isotope is consumed at the rate of about 1.23 g/day per megawatt of power if the fissions are induced primarily by thennal neutrons. Example 3.14 The energy released by the fissioning of 1 g of 235U is equivalent to the combustion of how much (a) coal with a heat content of 3 x 107 J/kg (13,000 Btullb) and (b) oil at 4.3 x 107 J/kg (6.5 x 106 Btulbarrel)? Solution. According to the prior discussion, the fissioning of 1 g of 235U releases approximately 1 megawatt/day = 24,000 kWh = 8.64 x 1010 1. 1. This energy is also released by 8 64 X 1010 . 7 = 2.88 X 103 kg = 2.88 metric tons 3 x 10 = 3.17 ST (short tons) of coal. [Ans.] 2. In terms of oil this is also 8.64 x 1010 3 4.3 X 107 = 2.00 x 10 kg = 2.00 t = 12.6 barrels. [Ans.] 3.8 ,·RAY INTERACTIONS WITH MATTER Although the tenn y-ray is nonnally reserved for radiation emitted by nuclei and x-ray refers to radiation originating in transitions of atomic electrons, both fonns of radiation are called y-rays in the present section. There is, of course, no fundamen­tal difference between the two radiations, per se, as they are both electromagnetic radiation. Gamma rays interact with matter in several ways. Ordinarily, however, only three processes must be taken into account in nuclear engineering problems. These are the photoelectric effect, pair production, and Compton effect.

 text: Sec. 3.8 y-Ray Interactions with Matter 91 The Photoelectric Effect In the photoelectric effect, the incident y-ray interacts with an entire atom, the y-ray disappears, and 1 of the atomic electrons is ejected from the atom. The atom recoils in this process, but carries with it very little kinetic energy. The kinetic energy of the ejected photoelectron is therefore equal to the energy of the photon less the binding energy of the electron to the atom-that is, the ionization energy for the electron in question. If a y-ray succeeds in ejecting an inner atomic electron, the hole in the elec­tronic structure is later filled by a transition of 1 of the outer electrons into the vacant position. This transition is accompanied by the emission of x-rays charac­teristic of the atom or by the ejection of an Auger electron (see Section 2.7). The cross-section per atom for the photoelectric effect is denoted by the sym­bol ape. This cross-section can be used in the same way as the neutron cross­sections discussed in the preceding sections. Thus, if I is the intensity of y-rays incident on a thin target containing N atoms per cm3, then I Nape is the number of photoelectric interactions/cm3 -sec. 105 .-----l----.,.sl-r,---+-----+----+---------l r,II,� 104 �--+__+-�--_+---�� 103�-�--�_4�\K-E-d-ge�--�-� � \\ b'6.. 102 1----+-------+-----\-\-----+---+------1 10�-- -+---�--�----�� \ '\� 0.1 "--__ ...i.....- __ -'- __ --'- ___ .l..-- -.I 0.001 0.01 0.1 10 Energy MeV Figure 3.15 The photoelectric cross-section of lead as a function of gamma ray energy.

 text: 92 Interaction of Radiation with Matter Chap. 3 The cross-section ape depends both on the energy E of the incident photon and the atomic number Z of the atom. Figure 3.15 shows ape for lead as a function of E. It should be noted that ape rises to very large values at low energy-less than 1 Me V. Photons in this energy region obviously do not penetrate far into a lead target (or shield). As also indicated in Fig. 3.15, there are a number of discontinuities in ape at low energy. These are called absorption edges and correspond to energies below which it is not possible to eject certain electrons from the lead atom. For instance, below the K -edge, the incident photon does not have sufficient energy to eject a K -electron-the most tightly bound electron. The next most tightly bound electrons after the K -electrons are the L-electrons. For reasons unimportant to the present discussion, these electrons have three slightly different ionization energies. The three edges denoted in the figure as L I, L I I, and L I I I correspond to the minimum photon energies required to eject the 3 differently bound L-electrons. Above the edges, that is, above the K -edge, ape drops off roughly as E-3 The photoelectric cross-section depends strongly on Z, varying as (3.59) where n is the function of E shown in Fig. 3.16. Because of the strong dependence of ape on Z, the photoelectric effect is of greatest importance for the heavier atoms, such as lead, especially at lower energies. Pair Production In this process, the photon disappears and an electron pair-a positron and a negatron-is created. Since the total rest-mass energy of the 2 electrons is 2mec2 = 1.02 Me V, this effect does not occur unless the photon has at least this much energy. Above this threshold, the cross-section for a pair production, app, increases steadily with increasing energy, as shown in Fig. 3.17, where the pair production cross-section is shown for lead. Since pair production is an electromagnetic interaction, it can take place only in the vicinity of a Coulomb field.

Once formed, these electrons move about and lose energy as a result of collisions with atoms in the surrounding medium. After the positron has slowed down to very low energies, it combines with a negatron, the two particles disappear, and two photons are produced (annihilation radiation), each having an energy of 0.511 Me V. The Compton Effect The Compton effect, or Compton scattering as it is sometimes called, is simply the elastic scattering of a photon by an electron, in which both energy and momentum are conserved.

Since the recoiling electron acquires some kinetic en­ergy, the energy E' of the scattered photon is less than E, and since the wavelength of a photon is inversely proportional to its energy (see Eq. 2.22), the wavelength A' of the scattered photon is larger than A. By setting up the equations for the conser­vation of energy and momentum, it is not difficult to derive the following relation: ,E Ee E = , E(l -cos 1J) + Ee (3.61) where Ee = mec2 = 0.511 Me V is the rest-mass energy of the electron. A formula equivalent to Eq. (3.61) is where A' -A = Ac(l -cos 1J), h 10 AC = -= 2.426 x 10-cm mec is called the Compton wavelength. (3.62) (3.63) In Compton scattering, the photon interacts with individual electrons, and it is therefore possible to define a Compton cross-section per electron e(JC. This cross­section decreases monotonically with increasing energy from a maximum value 0.665 b (essentially � of a barn) at E = 0, which is known as the Thompson cross­ section, (JT. Figure 3.19 shows e(J c as a function of photon energy. Incidentally, for E » Ee, e(JC behaves roughly as E-1 The Compton cross-section per atom, (Jc, is equal to the number of electrons in the atom-namely, Z-multiplied by e(JC. Thus, (3.64) From a practical standpoint, the Compton effect is the cause of many diffi­cult problems encountered in the shielding of y-rays. This is because the photon does not disappear in the interaction as it does in the photoelectric effect and in pair production. The Compton-scattered photon is free to interact again in another part of the system. Although it is true that x-rays and Auger electrons are emitted following the photoelectric effect and that annihilation radiation accompanies pair production, these radiations are always much less energetic than the initial photon and do not tend to propagate in matter to the same extent as Compton-scattered photons. This multiple scattering of y-rays is considered again in Chapter 10.

(3.65) by the atom density N. By tradition, such macroscopic y-ray cross-sections are called attenuation coefficients and are denoted by the symbol J-L. Thus, J-L = N a = J-Lpe + J-Lpp + J-Lc, (3.66) where J-L is the total attenuation coefficient and J-Lpe, J-Lpp, and J-Lc are the attenuation coefficients for the three interaction processes. Like macroscopic cross-sections for neutrons, the various J-L'S have units of em-I. It is also convenient to define the quantity J-L/ p, which is called the mass attenuation coe fficient,4 where p is the physical density. From Eq. (3.66), this is given by � = J-Lpe + J-Lpp + J-Lc . P P P P (3.67) 4 A new standard is now in use in which I-L is used to designate the mass attenuation coefficient and I-L * the attenuation coefficient. In this text, the older convention is used.

There is minimum in J-l/ p at about 3.5 Me V because ape and ac decrease with increasing y-ray energy, whereas app increases from its threshold at 1.02 Me V. Also, as shown in the figure, Compton scattering is the dominant mode of interac­tion from about 0.5 Me V to 5 Me V. Because ape and app depend more strongly on Z than does ac, the energy range over which Compton scattering is dominant in­creases with decreasing Z. 5 Thus, in the case of aluminum, for instance, Compton scattering predominates all the way from 0.06 Me V to 20 Me V.

A check of the chart of the nuclides shows that, except for hydrogen and the very heavy elements, the ratio Z / M is approxi­mately equal to !. This means that, at those energies where Compton scattering is the dominant process, values of J.L / p tend to be roughly the same for all elements. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.21, where J.L/ p is shown for a number of elements as a function of y-ray energy. Numerical values of J.L/ p are given in Table 11.4 in Appendix II.

Also, it is not difficult to show that the mass absorption coefficient for the mixture is related to the mass absorption coefficients of the constituents by the fonnula � = _1 [WI (�) +W2 (�) + p 100 PIP 2 J. (3.69) where WI, W2, and so on are the percents by weight of the various elements, and (/1-/ p) 1, (/1-/ P h, and so on are the mass absorption coefficients of the elements, as given in Table 11.4. Equations (3.68) and (3.69) are valid at all energies. By the same argument that led to Eq. (3.13), it is easy to show that /1-is equal to the probability per unit path that a y-ray will have a collision in a medium and that 1 A= -/1-(3.70) is the mean free path of the y-ray. Furthennore, if 10 is the intensity (y-rays/cm2-sec) of the monoenergetic y-ray beam striking a target of thickness X, then the intensity of the photons that penetrate the target without having a collision is (3.71) In terms of the mass attenuation coefficient, Eq. (3.71) may be written as (3.72) The quantity pX in Eq. (3.72) has units of g/cm2 and is equal to the number of grams contained in an area of 1 cm2 of the target. Thicknesses of materials are often given in units of g/cm2 in calculations of y-ray attenuation. It must be emphasized, as it was in the earlier discussion of neutrons, that the intensity I given in Eqs. (3.71) and (3.72) refers only to those often very few y-rays that do not interact in the target. These are by ne means the only photons that appear on the far side of a target or shield. Photons that have undergone multiple Compton scattering, photons from annihilation radiation following pair production, and the x-rays that follow the photoelectric effect may also penetrate the target. All of these radiations must be taken into account in shielding calculations. Methods for doing so are given in Chapter 10.

The density of V02 is about 10 g/cm3 Solution. The molecular weight of V02 is 238 + 2 x 16 = 270. The percent by weight that is uranium is then 238/270 = 88.1 %; the remaining 11.9% is oxygen. From Table 11.4, IJ.,/ P = 0.0757 cm2/g for uranium and 0.0636 cm 2/g for oxygen. Thus, for V02 � = 0.881 x 0.0757 + 0.119 x 0.0636 = 0.0743 cm2/g. [Ans.] p The value of J1, is 10 times this number, that is, J1, = 0.743 cm-1 since p = 10. The mean free path is 1 1 A = - = -- = 1.35 cm. [Ans.] J1, 0.743 Energy Deposition In calculations of radiation protection to be consid­ered in Chapter 9, it is necessary to compute the rate at which energy is deposited by a y-ray beam as it passes through a medium. By analogy with Eq. (3.8), the total collision density at a point where the y-ray intensity is I is given by F = I/L, (3.73) where /L is the total attenuation coefficient. If the y-rays were absorbed at each collision, then the rate at which energy is deposited per unit volume in the medium would be simply E F = E I /L, where E is the energy of the y-rays. With both the photoelectric effect and pair production, the incident photon is in fact absorbed. Unless the medium is very thin, most of the secondary radiation emitted subsequent to these interactions-the x-rays, electrons, and annihilation radiation-is also absorbed in the medium. Thus, the total energy of the incident y-ray can be assumed to be deposited in these processes. In Compton scattering, however, the only energy deposited is the kinetic energy of the recoiling electron. Let T be the average energy of this electron. The average energy deposited by Compton scattering is then T I/Lc, where /Lc is the Compton attenuation coeffi­cient. It is now convenient to define the Compton absorption cross-section aCa by the relation Eaca = Tac. (3.74) The corresponding Compton absorption coefficient /LCa is then given by E/Lca = T /Lc. (3.75) In terms of this coefficient, the energy deposition rate per unit volume by Compton scattering is simply E I /LCa.

 text: 100 Interaction of Radiation with Matter Chap. 3 The total energy deposition rate W per unit volume from photoelectric effect, pair production, and Compton scattering can now be written as where W = E I (/.Lpe + /.Lpp + /.Lea) = EI/.La, /.La = /.L pe + /.L pp + /.Lea (3.76) (3.77) is called the linear absorption coefficient.6 It can be seen that, by defining Mea according to Eq. (3.75), it is possible to treat all three modes of y-ray interaction on the same footing. The quantity /.La/pis called the mass absorption coefficient, and representa­tive values are given in Table 11.5. It is easy to see from Eq. (3.76) that the rate of energy deposition per unit mass is equal to E I /.La/ p. It should also be mentioned, in concluding this section, that the product E I that appears in Eq. (3.76) is called the energy intensity or energy flux. This has the units of energy per cm2/sec and is equal to the rate at which energy in a y-ray beam passes into a medium per cm2 Example 3.16 It is proposed to store liquid radioactive waste in a steel container. If the intensity of y-rays incident on the interior surface of the tank is estimated to be 3 x 1011 y-rays/cm2-sec and the average y-ray energy is 0.8 Me V, at what rate is energy deposited at the surface of the container? Solution. Steel is a mixture of mostly iron and elements such as nickel and chromium that have about the same atomic number as iron. Therefore, as far as y-ray absorption is concerned, steel is essentially all iron. From Table U.5, J.lal P for iron at 0.8 Me V is 0.0274 cm2/g. The rate of energy deposition is then 0.8 x 3 x lOll x 0.0274 = 6.58 x 109 Me V/g-sec. [Ans.] In SI units, this is equivalent to 1.05 J/kg-sec. 3.9 CHARG ED PARTICLES Ordinarily, there are only three varieties of charged particles that must be dealt with in nuclear engineering problems-namely, a-rays, fJ-rays, and fission fragments. Before considering these particular radiations, it is of interest to discuss the ways in which charged particles interact with matter. 6/.La is called the energy absorption coefficient by some authors.

 text: Sec. 3.9 Charged Particles 101 Consider a charged particle that is incident on an atom located at some point in bulk matter. A number of different events may occur as this particle nears the atom in question. First of all, because the particle exerts electrical (Coulomb) forces on the atomic electrons, one or more of these electrons may be placed into excited states of the atom, or an electron may be ejected from the atom altogether, leaving the atom ionized. However, the charged particle may penetrate through the cloud of atomic electrons and be elastically scattered from the nucleus. Since momentum and energy are conserved in such a collision, the nucleus necessarily recoils. If the incident particle is sufficiently massive and energetic, the recoiling nucleus may be ejected from its own electron cloud and move into the medium as another charged particle. Also, under certain circumstances, the incident particle, especially if it is an a-particle, may undergo some sort of nuclear reaction when it collides with the nucleus. Finally, the particle may be accelerated by the Coulomb field of the electrons or the nucleus; as a consequence, a photon may be emitted. This type of radiation, which is emitted whenever a charged particle undergoes acceleration, is called bremsstrahlung. It is clear from the foregoing that the interaction of a charged particle with matter is a complicated affair. In any case, it is evident that in its passage through matter such a particle leaves a trail of excitation and ionization along its path. In this context, because they are directly responsible for producing this ionization, charged particles are referred to as directly ionizing radiation. By contrast, uncharged par­ticles, such as y-rays and neutrons, lead to excitation and ionization indirectly only after first interacting in the substance and producing a charged particle. For this rea­son, y-rays and neutrons are said to be indirectly ionizing radiation. This is not to imply that y-rays and neutrons do not directly form ions when they interact-they do. For example, a y-ray produces photoelectric effect. Similarly, a neutron collid­ing with a nucleus may eject the nucleus from its atom as a highly charged ion. But the ionization arising from these first interactions of y-rays and neutrons is entirely insignificant compared with the ionization caused by the subsequent interaction of the charged particles. It is recalled that the interactions of neutrons and y-rays are described by cross-sections. Although it is also possible to define various interaction cross­sections for charged particles, it is more useful to describe the extent to which charged particles interact with matter in terms of either their specific ionization or their stopping power. The specific ionization of a particle is defined as the number of ion pairs produced per unit path traveled by the particle. An ion pair is an ion­ized atom together with its ejected electron. The stopping power is the total energy lost per path length by a charged particle; that is, it is the total rate of decrease in the energy of the particle along its path. If nuclear reactions involving the parti­cle do not occur, then the stopping power, which is denoted by S, can be written as

The first tenn in Eq. (3.78) is called the linear energy transfer (LET), and it is of special interest in connection with the biological effects of radiation. As shown in Chapter 9, these effects depend on the extent to which energy is deposited by radiation as excitation and ionization within biological systems. The magnitude of LET increases rapidly with the mass and charge of a moving particle. Thus, the LET of a-particles is considerably larger than for electrons of the same energy. For example, the LET of a I-Me Va-particle in water is about 90 keV/JLm, whereas it is only 0.19 keV/JLm for a I-Me V electron. For this reason, a-particles and other heavily charged particles are referred to as high LET radiation; electrons are called low LET radiation. Although linear energy transfer is due to the interactions of charged particles in matter, it is also possible to refer to the LET of uncharged, indirectly ionizing radiation-that is, y-rays and neutrons-since, as noted earlier, the bulk of the lo­cal deposition of energy by these radiations is due to the ionization and excitation that occurs subsequent to their first interaction in the material. Because y-rays pro­duce low LET secondary electrons, they are called low LET radiation. However, since neutron interactions lead to the heavy, high LET charged particles, neutrons are known as high LET radiation. The distinction between high and low LET radi­ation has important biological consequences that are described in Chapter 9. Alpha Particles Because a-particles are so massive, they are only slightly deflected when they interact with atomic electrons. Therefore, they move in more or less straight lines as they travel in a medium. However, as an a-particle slows down, it becomes increasingly probable that it will capture an electron to fonn an He+ ion and then capture a second electron to become a neutral helium atom. When, ultimately, this atom is fonned, the specific ionization abruptly drops to zero. This situation is illustrated in Fig. 3.22, where the specific ionization is shown for an energetic a-particle as a function of distance from the end of its track in dry air at 15°C and 1 atm pressure. The maximum value of the specific ionization shown in the figure is 6,600 ion pairs/mm. At this point, the a-particles have an energy of about 0.75 Me V. A curve of the type given in Fig. 3.22 is known as a Bragg curve. The point at which the ionization falls to zero is called the range of the (t­particle.1 As would be intuitively expected, the range is a monotonically increasing 7Because of the statistical nature of the processes involved, all a-particle tracks do not tenni­ nate at precisely the same point. The range described earlier is the most probable endpoint.

The range as a function of energy is shown in Fig. 3.23 for a-particles in air. Ranges of a-particles in other materials can be found from the range in air by using the Bragg-Kleeman rule: � -4,JM - = 3.2 x 10 --Ra. Ma P (3.79) In this formula, R is the range in a substance of physical density p and atomic weight M, and Ra, Pa, and Ma are the range, density, and average atomic weight of air, respectively. The numerical constant in Eq. (3.79) is computed for air at 15°C and 1 atm. For compounds or mixtures, ,JM in Eq. (3.79) is to be replaced by ,JM = YlJAi; + Y2jM; + (3.80) where Yl, Y2, and so on are the fractions of atoms present having atomic weights MI, M2, and so on. The relative stopping power of a material is defined as the ratio of the range of a-particles in air to the range of a-particles in the substance in question. From Eq. (3.79), this is given by Relative stopping power = Ra = 3100 �. R vM (3.81) It should be noted that the relative stopping power is independent of the initial energy of the particle.

For example, the range of a 5-Me V a­particle in aluminum is only 0.0022 em-about the thickness of thin aluminum foil. Most a-particles are stopped by an ordinary sheet of paper; they are also stopped in the outennost layers of living tissue. Thus, the shielding of a-particles does not ordinarily pose a difficult problem. However, the presence of a-decaying nuclides cannot be ignored in many engineering problems since, as is shown in Chapter 9, these nuclides can lead to serIous health hazards when ingested or inhaled. ,a-Rays The attenuation of f3-rays in matter in some ways is more compli­cated than for a-particles. To begin with, f3-rays are emitted in a continuous energy

 text: Sec. 3.9 Charged Particles 105 spectrum. Furthennore, although they interact with atoms in the same manner as a-particles, {3-rays, being less massive particles, are more strongly deflected in each encounter with an atom. As a result, f3-rays move in complicated, zigzag paths and not in straight lines as do a-particles. Nevertheless, it has been found experimentally that the specific ionization of a beam of f3-rays varies approximately exponentially with distance into an absorber. This phenomenon appears to be an accident of nature, due in part to the shape of the f3-ray spectrum. If i (x) is the specific ionization at the distance x into the absorber, then (3.82) where io is the specific ionization at x = 0 and P is the density of the medium. The apparent mass attenuation coefficient /L I P is almost independent of the atomic weight of the medium and increases only slowly with the atomic number. An ap­proximate, empirical fonnula for /La I p, based on measurements in aluminum, is /L 17 -=--, p E�l: where /LIp is in cm2/g and Emax is the maximum f3 -ray energy in Me V. (3.83) A more useful parameter related to the attenuation of f3-rays is the maximum range Rmax. This is defined as the thickness of absorber required to stop the most energetic of the electrons. The product RmaxP, which is the range expressed in units of g/cm2, is roughly independent of the nature of the absorbing medium. Values of RmaxP are shown in Fig. 3.24 as a function of the maximum electron energy Emax. These data can be represented by the following empirical fonnulas: and R P = 0 412E(1.265-0,0954 In Emax) max . max ' RmaxP = 0.530Emax -0.106, Emax < 2.5 Me V Emax > 2.5Me V In these equations, RmaxP is in g/cm2 and Emax is in Me V. (3.84) (3.85) Equations (3.84) and (3.85) give slightly lower values of RmaxP for air than are actually observed. Figure 3.25 gives the measured ranges of f3-rays for air at 15°C and 1 atm pressure. It is evident from a comparison of Figs. 3.23 and 3.25, and also by comparing calculated ranges, that f3-rays penetrate considerably further into materials than a-rays of comparable energy. For instance, f3-rays with Emax = 3 Me V have a range in air of 13 m, whereas the range of 3-Me Va-particles is only 1.7 cm. However, f3-rays do not penetrate far into nongaseous materials and, as a result, they are not difficult to shield.

What is the maximum range of the f3-rays in animal tissue? Solution. The density of most animal tissue is approximately unity. From Eq.

Fission Fragments In Section 3.7, it was pointed out that fissioning nu­clei almost always split into two fragments of unequal mass. Since momentum must be conserved in fission, the lighter group of fragments receives somewhat more energy than the heavier group. Therefore, the distribution of fission fragment

The average charge of the lighter group is approximately +20e; that of the heavier group is about + 22e .

Chap. 3 Because of their large charge, fission fragments specific ionization is very high, and their range is correspondingly short. Table 3.7 gives approximate ranges of the lighter, more energetic, and hence more penetrating fragments in various materials. The range of fission fragments is an important factor in the design of the fuel rods for power reactors. Since power (from the fissioning fuel) is produced in these rods, they must be cooled by the passage of a suitable coolant material along their surfaces, as shown in Fig. 3.27. However, it is important that none of the radioac­tive fission fragments enters and thereby contaminates the coolant. To prevent the escape of such fragments, the fuel is either wrapped in a layer of nonfuel-bearing material, such as stainless steel or an alloy of zirconium, or placed in hollow tubes fabricated from these materials. In view of the short ranges indicated in Table 3.7, this fuel element, cladding as it is called, can be quite thin-often no more than 0.05 cm thick.
