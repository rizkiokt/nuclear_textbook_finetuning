 text: 5 Neutron Diffusion and Moderation To design a nuclear reactor properly, it is necessary to predict how the neutrons will be distributed throughout the system. The importance of a knowledge of the neutron distribution is illustrated in an example in the following section. Unfortu­ nately, determining the neutron distribution is a difficult problem in general. The neutrons in a reactor move about in complicated paths as the result of repeated nuclear collisions. To a first approximation, however, the overall effect of these collisions is that the neutrons undergo a kind of diffusion in the reactor medium, much like the diffusion of one gas in another. The approximate value of the neu­ tron distribution can then be found by solving the diffusion equation-essentially the same equation used to describe diffusion phenomena in other branches of en­ gineering such as molecular transport. This procedure, which is sometimes called the diffusion approximation, was used for the design of most of the early reactors. Although more sophisticated methods have now been developed, it is still widely used to provide first estimates of reactor properties. 5.1 NEUTRON FLUX It was shown in Section 3.4 that, for monoenergetic neutrons, the reaction rate F is related to the macroscopic cross .. section Li and the flux ¢ by: 230

Thus, let neE) be defined as the neutron density per unit energy; that is, n(E)dE is the number of neutrons per cm3 with energies between E and E + dE. From Eq. (5.1), the interaction rate for these essentially monoenergetic neutrons is dF = beE) x n(E)dE x vee), (5.2) where the energy dependence of all parameters is noted explicitly. The total inter­ action rate is then given by the integral where F = f'" "E,(E)n(E)v(E)dE = f'" "E,(E)¢(E)dE, (5.3) ¢(E) = n(E)v(E) (5.4) is called the energy-dependent flux or the flux per unit energy. The limits on the integrals in Eq. (5.3) are written as 0 and 00 to indicate that the integration is to be carried out over all neutron energies. Equation (5.3) refers to the total interaction rate. Rates of particular interac­ tions can be found from similar expressions. Thus, the number of scattering colli­ sions per cm3/sec is F, = 100 "E,(E)¢(E)dE; (5.5) the number of neutrons absorbed per cm3/sec is (5.6) and so on. In the next few sections, it is assumed that the neutrons are monoenergetic. The diffusion of nonmonoenergetic neutrons is considered in Section 5.8. 5.2 FICK'S LAW Diffusion theory is based on Fick's law, which was originally used to account for chemical diffusion. It was shown early in chemistry that if the concentration of a

 text: 232 q,(x) Neutron Diffusion and Moderation Chap. 5 Figure 5.1 Neutron flux and x current. solute is greater in one region of a solution than in another, the solute diffuses from the region of higher concentration to the region of lower concentration. Further­ more, it was found that the rate of solute flow is proportional to the negative of the gradient of the solute concentration. This is the original statement of Fick's law. To a good approximation, neutrons in a reactor behave in much the same way as a solute in a solution. Thus, if the density (or flux) of neutrons is higher in one part of a reactor than in another, there is a net flow of neutrons into the region of lower neutron density. For example, suppose that the flux 1 varies along the x -direction as shown in Fig. 5.1. Then Fick' s law is written as d4> ix = -D-. dx (5.7) In this expression, ix is equal to the net number of neutrons that pass per unit time through a unit area perpendicular to the x-direction. ix has the same units as flux-namely, neutrons/cm 2-sec. The parameter D in Eq. (5.7) is called the diffusion coefficient and has units of cm. Equation (5.7) shows that if, as in Fig. 5.1, there is a negative flux gradient, then there is a net flow of neutrons along the positive x-direction as indicated in the figure. To understand the origin of this flow, consider the neutrons passing through the plane at x = O. These neutrons pass through the plane from left to right as the result of collisions to the left of the plane; conversely, they flow from right to left as the result of collisions to the right of the plane. However, since the concentration of neutrons and the flux is larger for negative values of x, there are more collisions per cm3/sec on the left than on the right. Therefore, more neutrons are scattered from left to right than the other way around, with the result that there is a net flow of neutrons in the positive x-direction through the plane, just as predicted by Eq. (5.7). It is important to recognize that neutrons do not flow from regions of high I It is usual in nuclear engineering to make calculations with the flux, which is proportional to neutron density, rather than with the clensity,

 text: Sec. 5.2 Fick's Law 233 flux to low flux because they are in any sense pushed that way. There are simply more neutrons scattered, or moving, in one direction than in the other. The flux is generally a function of three spatial variables, and in this case Pick's law is J = -D grad 4> = -DV4>. (5.8) Here J is known as the neutron current density vector or simply the current, and grad = V is the gradient operator. We have assumed that the diffusion coefficient, D, is not a function of the spatial variables.2 The physical significance of the vector J may be seen by taking the dot product of J with a unit vector in the x-direction ax. This gives the x-component of J, namely Jx: which, as already noted, is equal to the net flow of neutrons per second per unit area normal to the x-direction. It follows that if 0 is a unit vector pointing in an arbitrary direction, then J 0 = In (5.9) is equal to the net flow of neutrons per second per unit area normal to the direction ofo. Example 5.1 In Section 5.6, it is shown that the flux at the distance r from a point source emitting S neutrons per second in an infinite moderator is given by the fonnula Se-r/L <p(r) = --, 41TDr where L is a constant. Find expressions for (a) the neutron current in the medium, (b) the net number of neutrons flowing out through a sphere of radius r surrounding the source. Solution. 1. Because of the geometry of the problem, the neutron current density vector clearly must point outward in the radial direction. From Appendix III, the r­ component of the gradient, V r, in spherical coordinates is d Vr = ar-, dr where ar is a unit radial vector. Then from Fick's law, Eq.

Since J is everywhere normal to the surtace of the sphere, the net number of neutrons crossing per unit area of the sphere is just the magnitude of J, that is, J ar = J The net flow through the whole sphere of area 41T r2 is then 41Tr2 J(r) = S (1 + f) e-rlL [Ans.] Returning to Eqs. (5.7) and (5.8), it may be noted that, since Jx and J have the same units as cp, D has units of length.3 It can be shown by arguments,4 which are too lengthy to be reproduced here, that D is given approximately by the following fonnula: Atr D=3' where Atr is called the transport mean free path and is given in tum by 1 1 Atr = I;tr = I;s(1 -J.1,)' (5.10) (5.11) In this equation, I;tr is called the macroscopic transport cross-section. I;s is the macroscopic scattering cross section of the medium, and 7I is the average value of the cosine of the angle at which neutrons are scattered in the medium. The value of 7I at most of the neutron energies of interest in reactor calculations can be computed from the simple fonnula Example 5.2 2 7I = 3A' (5.12) The scattering cross-section of carbon at 1 eV is 4.8 b. Estimate the diffusion coeffi­ cient of graphite at this energy. 2 Solution. Using Eq. (5.12) with A = 12 gives Ji = 36 = 0.555. From Table 11.3, the atom density of graphite is 0.08023 x 1024 Introducing these values into Eqs. (5.11) and (5.12) gives 1 D=----3Ls(1 -Ji) 3 x 0.08023 x 4.8(1 -0.055) = 0.916 cm. [Ans.] It must be emphasized that Fick's law is not an exact relation. Rather, it is an approximation that in particular is not valid under the following ecmclitiens: 3In chemistry and chemical engineering, Fick's law is written in terms of concentration rather than flux. The units of the diffusion coefficient in that case are cm2/sec. 4See particularly the first two references by Glasstone et a1.

When the scattering of neutrons is strongly anisotropic. To some extent, these limitations are present in every practical reactor prob­ lem. Nevertheless, as noted earlier, Fick's law and diffusion theory are often used to estimate reactor properties. Higher order methods are available for cases near sources or boundaries and in strongly absorbing media. 5.3 THE EQUATION OF CONTINUITY Consider an arbitrary volume V within a medium containing neutrons. As time goes on, the number of neutrons in V may change if there is a net flow of neutrons out of or into V, if some of the neutrons are absorbed within V, or if sources are present that emit neutrons within V The equation of continuity is the mathematical statement of the obvious fact that, since neutrons do not disappear unaccountably,5 the time rate of change in the number of neutrons in V must be accounted for in terms of these processes. In particular, it follows that [Rate of change in number of neutrons in V _ [ rate of absorption of neutrons in V Each of these terms is considered in tum. ] -[ rate of production ] - of neutrons in V ] _ [ rate of leakage of ] neutrons from V (5.13) Let n be the density of neutrons at any point and time in V The total number of neutrons in V is then where the subscript on the integral indicates that the integration is to be performed throughout V The rate of change in the number of neutrons is � { ndV dt iv 5Neutrons do disappear, of course, when they undergo ,B-decay. However, this process has a comparatively long half-life and need not be taken into consideration.

Next, let s be the rate at which neutrons are emitted from sources per cm3 in V The rate at which neutrons are produced throughout V is given by Production rate = i sdV The rate at which neutrons are lost by absorption per cm3/sec is equal to L.a¢, where L.a is the macroscopic absorption cross-section (which may be a function of position) and ¢ is the neutron flux. Throughout the volume V, the total loss of neutrons per second due to absorption is then Absorption rate = i '£a<PdV Consider next the flow of neutrons into and out of V If J is the neutron current density vector on the surface of V and n is a unit nonnal pointing outward from the surface, then, according to the results of the preceding section, J n is the net number of neutrons passing outward through the surface per cm2/sec. It follows that the total rate of leakage of neutrons (which may be positive or negative) through the surface A of the volume is Leakage rate = i J ndA. This surface integral can be transfonned into a volume integral by using the diver­ gence theorem (see Appendix III). Thus, i J ndA = i div JdV, and so Leakage rate = i div JdV The equation of continuity can now be obtained by introducing the prior re­ sults into Eq. (5.13). This gives

The equation must hold for any arbitrary volume. Therefore, the integrands on the right when summed must equal to the integrand on the left. Thus, an - = s - L.a ¢ -div J. at (5.14) Equation (5.14) is the general form of the equation of continuit y. If the neu­ tron density is not a function of time, this equation reduces to div J + L.a¢ -S = 0, (5.15) which is known as the steady-state equation of continuity. 5.4 THE DIFFUSION EQUATION Unfortunately, the continuity equation has two unknowns-the neutron density, n, and the neutron current density vector, J. To eliminate one of these requires a relationship between them. The relationship is based on the approximation that the current and flux are related by Fick's law (Eq. 5.8). On substitution of Fick's law into the equation of continuity (Eq. 5.14), one obtains the neutron diffusion equation. Assuming that D is not a function of position, this gives 2 an D'1 ¢ -L.a¢ + s = at' (5.16) where the symbol '12 = div grad is called the Laplacian. Fonnulas for the Lapla­ cian in various coordinate systems are given in Appendix III. Since ¢ = nv, where v is the neutron speed, Eq. (5.16) can also be written as 2 1 a¢ D'1¢-L.a¢+s=--. v at (5.17) In the remainder of this chapter, only time-independent problems are consid­ ered. In this case, Eq. (5.17) becomes This is the steady-state diffusion equation. It is often convenient to divide Eq. (5.18) by D, which gives 2 1 s V ¢-L2¢= D' (5.18) (5.19)

Since D and I:a have units of cm and cm- 1 , respectively, it follows from Eq. (5.20) that L 2 has units of cm2 a�d L has units of cm. A physical interpretation of Land L 2 is given later in this chapter. 5.5 BOUND ARY CONDITIONS The neutron flux can be found by solving the diffusion equation. Since the diffusion equation is a partial differential equation, it is necessary to specify certain boundary conditions that must be satisfied by the solution. Some of these are determined from obvious requirements for a physically reasonable flux. For example, since a negative or imaginary flux has no meaning, it follows that ¢ must be a real, non­ negative function. The flux must also be finite, except perhaps at artificial singular points of a source distribution. In many problems, neutrons diffuse in a medium that has an outer surface­ that is, a surface between the medium and the atmosphere. It was pointed out in Section 5.2 that Fick's law is not valid in the immedia te vicinity of such a surface, and it follows that the diffusion equation is not valid there either. Higher order methods show, however, that if the flux calculated from the diffusion equation is assumed to vanish at a small distance d beyond the surface, then the flux deter­ mined from the diffusion equation is very nearly equal to the exact flux in the interior of the medium. The assumption that the flux vanishes a small distance d beyond the surface is clearly nonphysical. Rather, it is a convenient mathematical approximation that provides a high degree of accuracy for estimates of the flux inside the medium. This state of affairs is illustrated in Fig. 5.2. The parameter d is known as the extrapolation distance, and for most cases of interest it is given by the simple formula d = 0.71)'-tr, where Atr is the transport mean free path of the medium. From Eq . (5.10), Atr = 3D and so d becomes d = 2.13D. (5.21) (5.22)

Thus, from Eq. (5.22), it is seen that d is usually small compared with most reactor dimensions. It is often possible, therefore, when solving the diffusion equation to assume that the flux vanishes at the actual surface of the system. In those cases where d is not negligible, we must establish a mathematical boundary for the problem. This boundary is referred to as the extrapolated bound­ ary. It is located a distance d from the real physical boundary. This boundary con­ dition is referred to as the vacuum boundary condition. It is typically imposed in problems where there is a media having a low density or in a region at the edge of the problem where there are few neutrons that reenter the regions of interest. A typical case is in the air-filled annulus outside the reactor vessel. In such cases, the dimensions of the problem are increased by d. For our case, if the distance from the center of the diffusing media in Fig. 5.2 is a, then the distance to the extrapolated boundary is a + d, and we define the quantity a as a = a +d. It is on the boundary at a that the flux is assumed to vanish.6 It is also necessary to specify boundary conditions at an interface between two different diffusing media, such as the interface between the reactor core and the reflector. Since the neutrons cross an interface without hindrance, it is not difficult to see that both the flux and component of the current normal to the surface must 6It must be emphasized that the assumption that the flux vanishes is merely a mathematical convenience. The flux is nonzero beyond the boundary and varies in a way defined by the geometry and material properties in that region.

 text: 240 Neutron Diffusion and Moderation Chap. 5 be continuous across the boundary. Thus, at an interface between two regions A and B, the following relations must be satisfied: cPA = cPs (JA)n = (JS)n, (5.23) (5.24) where cPA and cPs are, respectively, the fluxes in region A and B evaluated at the interface, and (J A) nand (Js) n are the nonnal components of the neutron current evaluated at the interface. Equations (5.23) and (5.24) are sometimes called inter­ face boundary conditions. 5.6 SOLUT IONS OF THE DIFFUSION EQUATION Some simple diffusion problems are now considered to illustrate how the diffusion equation may be solved subject to the prior boundary conditions. These methods are applied in Chapter 6 to calculations of reactor properties. Infinite Planar Source Consider first an infinite planar source emitting S neutrons per cm2/sec in an infi­ nite diffusing medium. Examining Fig. 5.3, one sees that there is no variation in the y or z direction that could cause the flux to change. The flux in this case can only be a function of x-the distance from the plane. Also on further examination, one sees that the problem has symmetry about the x = 0 plane. The solution can then be divided into one for x > 0 and one for x < O. Since there are no neutron sources present except at x = 0, the diffusion equation (Eq. 5.19) for x i= 0 becomes d2¢ 1 dx2 -L2 cP = 0, x i= 0. (5.25) Because of symmetry, we need only solve the equation in one-half of the plane. Then, by an appropriate transfonnati on, one may obtain the solution for the other S n/sec Figure 5.3 Planar source at origin x = 0 x = o.

As discussed earlier, this is a second order differential equation that requires two boundary conditions. The boundary conditions may be determined by recalling that the flux must be everywhere finite and positive definite. For this problem, the flux must remain finite as x goes to either positive or negative infin ity. This condition may be used here. Equation (5.25) has the following general solution: (5.26) where A and C are constants 7 to be determined by the boundary conditions. For the moment, consider the right-half plane where we have only positive values of x. Since the second term in Eq. (5.26) increases without limit with increasing x, it follows that C must be taken to be zero. Equation (5.26) then reduces to (5.27) The constant A in Eq. (5.27) is found in the following way. Suppose that a small pillbox of unit surface area and thickness 2x is constructed at the source plane as shown in Fig. 5.4. There clearly is no net flow of neutrons parallel to the source plane through the sides of the pillbox since the source plane and medium are infinite in this direction. Therefore, in view of the symmetry of the problem in the x direction, the net flow of neutrons out of the pillbox is simply 2J(x), where J (x) is the neutron current density on the surface of the pillbox located at x. In the limit as x goes to zero, the net flow out of the box must approach S, the source 7The symbol B has a special meaning in nuclear engineering and is not used as a constant in calculations of the present type.

(5.29) Point Source Consider next a point source emitting S neutrons per second isotropically in an infinite medium. If the source point is taken to be at the center of a spherical co­ordinate system, the flux obviously only depends on r.

(5.30), it is convenient to introduce a new variable, w, defined by w =r¢. (5.32) When Eq. (5.32) is substituted into Eq. (5.30), the following equation is found for w: d2w 1 ----w =0. dr2 L2 The general solution to this equation is obviously the same as for the planar source and ¢ is therefore w = ae-r/L + Cer/L e-r/L er/L ¢=A--+C-, r r where A and C are unknown constants. Again, as in the preceding example, ¢ must remain finite as r becomes infinite, so that C must be placed equal to zero. The constant A is found from the source condition, Eq. (5.31). Thus, J = _Dd¢ = DA (_1 +�) e-r/L dr r L r2 and so The flux is therefore given by S A--­-4nD· Se-r/L ¢----4nDr· (5.33) It is important to note that this solution is quite different than would be obtained for a point source in a vacuum (see Problem 5.1). This difference occurs since the diffusing media both absorbs and scatters neutrons, whereas a vacuum does not.

Since the current represents the net number of neutrons passing through a sur­ face per cm2/sec, the number of neutrons leaking per cm2/sec can be found by computing the neutron current at the surface of the slab.

The probability that a neutron escapes is equal to the number that escape per cm2/sec divided by the number emitted per cm2/sec by the source. For example, if 100 neutrons are emitted per cm2/sec and 10 escape from the surface, then the probability that a source neutron will ultimately escape is 10/100 = 100 = 0.10.

To this end, consider a monoenergetic point source emitting S neutrons per sec­ ond in an infinite homogeneous moderator. As these neutrons diffuse about in the medium, individual neutrons move in complica ted, zigzag paths due to successive collisions as indicated in Fig. 5.7. Eventually, however, every neutron is absorbed in the medium-none can escape since the medium is infinite.

Since S neutrons per second are emitted by the source and dn are absorbed per second between r and r + dr, it follows that the probability per )dr that a source neutron is absorbed in dr is It is now possible to compute the average distance from the source at which a neutron is absorbed by averaging r over the probability distribution p(r)dr For somewhat obscure reasons, however, it is more usual in nuclear engineering to compute the average of the square of this distance, rather than the average of the distance itself. Thus, Solving for L 2 gives (5.37) In words, Eq. (5.37) states that L 2 is equal to one .. sixth the average of the square of the vector (crow-flight) distance that a neutron travels from the point

It follows from this result that the greater the value of L, the further neutrons move, on the average, before they are absorbed, thus the more diffusive and less absorptive the medium is. Measured values of Land L 2 for thermal neutrons are discussed in Section 5.9. 5.8 THE GROUP-DIFFUSION METHOD In Chap. 3, the energy dependence of the flux was discussed and a method intro­ duced for approximating the dependence for the thermal flux. Since neutrons in a nuclear reactor actually have a distribution in energy, this distribution must be accounted for in the diffusion equation. To begin with, neutrons are emitted in fis­ sion with a continuous energy spectrum X (E), and this distribution broadens as the neutrons are scattered in the medium and diffuse about the system, losing energy in elastic and inelastic collisions. In thermal reactors, it is recalled, most of the fission neutrons succeed in slowing down all the way to thermal energies before they are absorbed in the fuel. In fast reactors, they slow down much less before inducing the fissions required to maintain the chain reaction. One of the most effective ways to calculate the slowing down and diffusion of neutrons is by the group-diffusion method. In this method, the entire range of neutron energy is divided into N energy intervals as indicated in Fig. 5.8. All of the neutrons within each energy interval are then lumped together, and their diffusion, scattering, and absorption are described in terms of suitably averaged diffusion coefficients and cross-sections. Consider, for instance, the neutrons in the gth energy interval-these are called the gth group neutrons. (Note that, by convention, the most energetic group is denoted by g = 1; the least energetic group has g = N.)

 text: Sec. 5.8 The Group-Diffusion Method 249 describing these neutrons, it is first necessary to define the flux of neutrons in this group as </>8 = 1. </>(E)dE, (S.38) where ¢(E) is the energy-dependent flux defined in Section S.1, and the subscript on the integral means that the integration is carried out over all energies within the group. Clearly all we have done is sum the flux within the energy range defined by the gth energy group. Neutrons disappear from the gth group both in absorption reactions and as the result of scattering collisions that cause them to change their energy such that they no longer belong to the gth energy group but instead to another group. The total absorption rate per cm3 in the gth group is given by the integral Absorption rate = 1. "2:.a(E)</>(E)dE. Thus, we have again summed simply all the events that occur in the gth group. By defining the macroscopic group absorption cross-section l:ag as (S.39) the absorption rate can be written as a product of the group cross-section and the group flux Absorption rate = l:ag¢g. (S.40) The rate at which neutrons in the gth group are scattered into the hth group is written in a form analogous to Eq. (S.40)-namely, Transfer rate, g to h = l:g---+h¢g. (5.41) The quantities l:g---+h are called group transfer cross-sections; their derivation is somewhat complica ted and is not given here. In any case, they may be viewed as known numbers that depend on the scattering properties of the medium. The total rate at which neutrons are scattered out of the gth group per cm3/sec is then 10 IOIt is assumed here that neutrons can only lose energy in a scattering collision, which is true for energetic neutrons. However, at low thermal energies, a neutron can gain energy in a collision with the nucleus of an atom in thennal motion. Such upscattering must be taken into account in group-diff usion calculations involving low-energy neutrons.

In this case, we are assuming only down scattering to occur and no upscatter ing. Neutrons enter the gth group either from sources that emit neutrons directly into the group or as the result of scattering from groups at higher energy. The number per cm3/sec entering g from the hth group is Transfer rate h to g = L.h---+ g¢h, (5.43) and the total number scattered into g is obtained by summing over all groups that can scatter into the gth group-that is, all higher energy groups: g-l Total transfer rate into g = L L.h---+ g¢h. h=l Again, we have assumed that no upscattering takes place. (5.44) Combining the prior tenns in the obvious way gives the following steady­ state diffusion equation for the gth group neutrons: N g-l Dg V2¢g - L.ag¢g -L L.g---+h¢g + L L.h---+g¢h = -Sg. h=g+l h=l In this equation, D g' the group-dif fusion coefficient, is given by 1 j 1 j 1 Dg = -D(E)¢(E)dE = - --¢(E)dE, ¢g g 3¢g g L.tr(E) (5.45) (5.46) where L.tr is the transport cross-section, and S g is the total number of neutrons emitted per cm3/sec into the group from sources. The multi group approximation fonns the basis for many reactor analysis codes used today. Computer codes such as DIFF3D and SIMULATE use this ap­ proach. Example 5.5 Microscopic three-group cross-sections of sodium for calculations of sodium-co oled fast reactors are given in Table 5.1. Suppose that at some point in such a reactor the three group fluxes are ¢1 = 6 x 1014, ¢2 = 1 x 1015, and ¢3 = 3 x 1015 Calculate for this point the number of neutrons (a) absorbed per cm3/sec in sodium; (b) scattered per cm3/sec from the first group to the second as the result of collisions with sodium. The sodium is at normal density.

(5.45), or the multigroup equations as they are sometimes called, it is common practice to use a computer program to evaluate the group fluxes. The techniques by which this is done involve approximating the derivatives by numerical methods and then requir­ ing the equations hold only at a series of discrete points in space. The equations are then reduced to algebraic equations valid for only those points. The exact ap­ proaches vary, and such methods lie beyond the scope of this text. It suffices here to note that many computer programs such as those mentioned earlier have been written by which the equations represented by Eq. (5.45) can be evaluated. In the special case of a one-group calculation, the group-transf er terms are missing and Eq. (5.45) reduces to (5.47)

 text: 252 Neutron Diffusion and Moderation Chap. 5 where the sUbscript denoting the group number has been omitted. It is observed that Eq. (5.47) is precisely the same as the diffusion equation for monoenergetic neutrons, as would be expected from the derivation of the group equations. The one-group and multigroup methods are utilized in Chapter 6 for calculations of reactor criticality. 5.9 THERM AL NEUTRON DIFFUSION An important application of the one-group method is in the diffusion of thennal neutrons. It is recalled that these are neutrons that have slowed down to thennal energies and whose energy distribution is given by the Maxwellian function (see Section 2.12), 2rrn nee) = E1/2e-E/kT (rrkT)3/2 (5.48) In this fonnula, nee) is defined so that n(E)d E is the number of neutrons per cm3 with energies between E and E + dE, and n is the total neutron density (i.e. neutrons per cm3). From Eq. (5.4), the energy-dependent flux for thennal neutrons is CP(E) = n(E)v(E) _ 2rrn (�) 1/2 e-E/kT -(rrkT)3/2 m U sing the usual fonnula for speed, (2E)I/2 vee) = - m (5.49) where m is the neutron mass, has been introduced. The one-group thennal flux, which is denoted as CPT, is then given by Eq. (5.38) as q,T = i q,(E)dE, (5.50) where the subscript T on the integral signifies that the integration is to be carried out over thennal energies, which are nonnally taken to extend up to about 5kT � 0.1 e V. However, since the exponential in cP (E) drops to such small values above this energy, very little error is made by carrying the integral to infinity. Substituting Eq. (5.49) then gives 2rrn (2)1/2100 -E kT 2n (2kT)1/2 CPT = - e / dE = - - (rr kT)3/2 m 0 fi m (5.51)

 text: Sec. 5.9 Thermal Neutron Diffusion 253 At this point, it is convenient to denote by ET the neutron energy correspond­ ing to kT and to let VT be the corresponding speed-that is, ET = kT (S.S2) and 1 2 -mvT = ET. 2 (S.S3) The numerical values of ET and VT can be computed from the following formulas: ET = 8.617T X 10-5 eV (S.S4) and VT = 1.284T1/2 X 104 cm/sec, (5.55) where T is the temperature in degrees Kelvin. Equation (5.51) can now be written as 2 <PT = ,;nnvT. (5.56) It is important to recognize that the thermal flux <PT and the 2,200 meters­ per-second flux <Po, which was defined in Section 3.6, are quite different concepts. Thus, although <PT represents the flux of all thermal neutrons lumped together and computed by the integral in Eq. (5.50), <Po is not a real flux, but a pseudoflux cal­ culated by assuming that all the thermal neutrons have only one energy-namely, Eo = 0.0253 eY. That is <Po is a number created to yield the same reaction rate obtained in the actual case using the value of the cross-section at Eo. In contrast, the flux <PT is the sum over energy of all the flux of particles at each energy in the thermal range. The thermal flux <PT is appropriate for calculations involving the diffusion of thermal neutrons, whereas the flux <Po is more useful in computations of neutron absorption rates in targets exposed to thermal neutrons. To put it sim­ ply, <PT is used in the design of a reactor, whereas <Po is appropriate when using a reactor. The relationship between the two fluxes can be found by dividing <Po by <PT, where <Po is given by <Po = nvo, where Vo = 2,200 meters/sec. This gives 2 VT (5.57)

page number: 272
 text: 254 Neutron Diffusion and Moderation However, Vo can be computed from Eq. (5.55) as Vo = 1.284Tol/2 X 104 cm/sec, using the value of To = 293.61 K. Then Eq. (5.57) becomes which is the desired relation. ¢o = -JJi (To) 1/2 ¢T 2 T Chap. 5 (5.58) The diffusion coefficient in a one-group calculation of thermal neutron diffu­sion is denoted as D and is obtained by evaluating the integral in Eq. (5.46) or from measurements of thermal neutrons. Values of D are given in Table 5.2 for several moderators. The one-group thermal absorption cross-section, denoted by La, is found from Eq. (5.39): -I], La = -La(E)¢(E)dE. ¢T T The integral is just the total absorption rate, and from Eq. (3.38) this is equal to where ga(T) is the non-1/v factor, La(Eo) is the macroscopic absorption cross­section at 0.0253 eV, and ¢o is the 2,200 meters-per-second flux. Thus, La becomes TABLE 5.2 THERMAL NEUTRON DIFFUSION PARAMETERS OF COMMON MODERATORS AT 20°C* Density, Moderator g/cm3 75, cm 1:" a, cm-1 L�, cm2 H2O 1.00 0.16 0.0197 8.1 D20t 1.10 0.87 9.3 x 10-· 9.4 X 103 Be 1.85 0.50 1.04 x 10-3 480 Graphite 1.60 0.84 2.4 x 10-4 3500 (5.59) LT,cm 2.85 97 21 59 *Based on Reactor Physics Constants, 2nd ed., Argonne National Laboratory report ANL-5800, 1963, Section 3.3. tD20 containing 0.25 weight/percent H20.

 text: Sec. 5.9 Thermal Neutron Diffusion 255 where use has been made of Eq. (5.58). Numerical values of La at 20De for the common moderator s, for which ga (T) is unity, are given in Table 5.2. With the thermal flux defined and the parameters D and La known, it is now possible to write down the one-group- diffusion equation for thermal neutrons. From Eq. (5.47), this is (5.60) in which ST is the density of thermal neutron sources. Dividing Eq. (5.60) by D gIves where 21s T V ¢T --2 ¢T = -=, LT D 2 D LT = =­La (5.61) (5.62) is called the thermal diffusion area; LT is the thermal diffusion length. Table 5.2 also gives values of these parameters. It is observed that Eq. (5.61) is identical in form to the diffusion equation for monoenergetic neutrons (see Eq. 5.19), and it follows that the solutions to this equation are valid for thermal neutrons provided D, L 2, and ¢ are replaced by D, L}, and ¢T. This is illustrated by the next example. Example 5.6 A point source emitting 107 thermal neutrons per second is located in an infinite body of unit-density water at room temperature. What is the thermal neutron flux 15 cm from the source? Solution. The flux is given by Eq. (5.33) with appropriate changes in designations of the parameters-that is, Se-r/L, CPT =----=--. 47TDr From Table 5.2, LT = 2.85 cm and D = 0.16 cm. Also, S = 107 and r = 15 cm. Inserting these values gives 107 x e-15/2.85 CPT = = 1.72 X 103 neutrons!cm 2-sec. [Ans.] 47T x 0.16 x 15 The values of the thermal diffusion parameters given in Table 5.2 are for nor­ mal density and room temperature. It is often necessary to know these parameters at other densities and temperature s, and these can be found by appropriately mod­ ifying the tabulated values. Consider first La.

The dependence of �a on temperature is given by Eq. (S.S9). According to Eqs. (S.10) and (S.11), the diffusion coefficient is inversely pro­ portional to �s. Since this is also proportional to p, 1 D"-'-. p The situation with regard to temperature is somewhat more complica ted. For mod­ erators other than H20 and D20, D is essentially independent of temperature. How­ ever, for H20, D varies approximately as D "-' T°.470 whereas for D20, it behaves as where T is the absolute temperature. The dependence of D on p and T may then be summarized by _ _ (�)(T)m D(p, T) = D(po, To) p To (S.63) where D(po, To) is the value of D at density Po and temperature To, and m = 0.470 for H20 and 0.112 for D20 and zero otherwise. Finally, by combining the previous results with the definition of L} given in Eq. (S.62), it is not difficult to see that ( )2 (T )m+1/2 L}(p, T) = L}(po, To):o To The utility of these expressions is shown by the following example.

The density of water at this temperature and pressure is 49.61b/ft3 Solution. From Table 5.2, D(po, To) = 0.16 cm at Po = 1 g/cm3 = 62.4 Ib/ft3 and To = 293°K. Using the formula relating temperature on the Celsius and Fahrenheit

The absolute temperature is then T = 260 + 273 = 533°K. Substituting these values into Eq. (5.64) then gives _ (62.4) (533)°.470 D = 0.16 x -x - = 0.267 cm.

One group is necessary to describe the thermal neutrons in the manner explained in the preceding section. The second or fast group includes all the neutrons having energies above thermal-that is, the neutrons that are slowing down from fission energies to about 5k T As preparation for the computations to be presented in Chapter 6, it is conve­ nient at this point to illustrate the use of two groups in a simple example. Consider, therefore, the problem of computing the two-group fluxes as a function of distance from a point source emitting S fission (fast) neutrons per second in an infinite uni­ form moderator. The group-diff usion equation for the fast neutrons can be obtained from the general group-diff usion equation, Eq. (5.45), with g = 1. However, the absorption cross-sections of all moderating materials are small, especially above the thermal energy region, and so �al can be taken to be zero. Also, since there are only 2 groups in the calculation, neutrons scattered out of the fast group necessarily must enter the thermal group. Thus, only �1�2 is nonzero in the third term of Eq. (5.45). Furthermore, the last term in this equation is zero because no neutrons are scattered into the fast group. The diffusion equation for the fast neutrons is thus simply approximated by (5.65) In this equation, �l has been written for the transfer cross-section �1�2. The source term is zero since there are no sources except at the point source. In nuclear reactor theory, the number of neutrons that slow down to thermal energies per cm3/sec is known as the slowing-down density and is usually denoted

page number: 276
 text: 258 Neutron Diffusion and Moderation Chap. 5 by the symbol qT. The tenn 1:1<Pl in Eq. (5.65) is equal to the number of neutrons scattered per cm3/sec from the fast group to the thennal group. Since the neutrons entering the thennal group have obviously just slowed down, it follows that 1: 1 <PI is also equal to the slowing-down density-that is, (5.66) To tum next to the thennal neutrons, these are described by the thermal dif­ fusion equation, Eq. (5.61). However, the only source of thennal neutrons in the problem are those that slow down out of the fast group. Since these appear at the rate of qT neutrons per cm3/sec, the source tenn in Eq. (5.61) is 1:1<Pl. The thennal group equation is then 2 1 1:1<Pl V <PT --2 <PT = �. LT D (5.67) To find <PT from Eq. (5.67), it is necessary first to solve Eq. (5.65) for <PI. In view of the symmetry of the problem, both <PI and <PT clearly depend only on r, the distance from the source. Dividing Eq. (5.65) through by DI and writing the Laplacian in spherical coordinates then gives where TT is defined as 1 d 2d<PI 1 --r ---<PI =0. r2 dr dr TT DI TT =-. 1:1 (5.68) (5.69) The parameter TT occurs in many types of reactor problems and is called the neu­ tron age. It is given this odd name because it can be shown to be a function of how long it takes a neutron to slow down. The age does not have units of time, however. As seen from Eq. (5.69), TT actually has units of cm2 A comparison of Eq. (5.68) with Eq. (5.30), which describes the diffusion of neutrons from a point source, shows that these two equations are identical except that TT in Eq. (5.68) replaces L 2 in Eq. (5.30). As a consequence, the solution to Eq. (5.68) is given by Eq. (5.33), but with y'TT written for Land DI, for D Se-rlFr <PI = . 4n Dlr (5.70) Furthennore, it is recalled from Section 5.7 that L 2 is equal to one sixth the average of the square of the crow-flight distance that a neutron travels from the source to the point where it is finally absorbed. The same kind of interpretation can be made for TT, except that neutrons are not absorbed in the fast group--they are scattered

page number: 277
 text: Sec. 5.10 Two-Group Calculation of Neutron Moderation 259 out of that group and into the thennal group. It is not difficult to see, therefore, that the parameter TT is equal to one-sixth the average of the square of the crow-flight distance from the point where a neutron is emitted as a fast neutron to the point where it slows down to thermal energies. In symbols, I- TT = -r2. 6 (5.71) The age of neutrons as defined by Eq. (5.71) can be detennined experimentally. Measured values of TT for fission neutrons in various moderators are given in Table 5.3. When Eq. (5.70) is substituted into Eq. (5.67), the result is an inhomogeneous differential equation. The details of solving this equation are not given here. It can be readily verified by direct substitution, however, that the solution is SL2 ¢T = : (e-r/LT - e-r/.;TT). 4rrr D(L'T -TT) (5.72) This expression gives the thennal flux arising from a point source of fast neu­ trons according to two-group theory. It must be emphasized that Eq. (5.72) is by no means exact. Indeed, a two-group model is not particularly appropriate for computing the slowing down of neutrons in most media-there are far better and more accurate (and more complica ted) methods for calculating the slowing down of neutrons from point sources. Nevertheless, as shown in Chapter 6, the two-group model can be used for rough, first -order calculations of thennal reactors. Incidentally, the experimental values of TT given in Table 5.3 are for moder­ ators at room temperature and normal density. Neither D} nor �l in Eq. (5.69) is particularly sensitive to temperature, but both depend on density. To compute TT at other than nonnal density, it may be noted that TT, like L}, varies inversely as the square of the density. Thus, the value of TT at density P is given by TT(P) = TT(Po) (; r where TT (Po) is the age at density Po.
