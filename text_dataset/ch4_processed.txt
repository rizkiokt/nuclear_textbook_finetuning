 text: 4 Nuclear Reactors and Nuclear Power Having reviewed in the preceding Chapters the atomic and nuclear physics that form the foundation for nuclear engineering, it is now possible to consider the manner by which nuclear energy is utilized for practical purposes. 4.1 THE FISSION CHAIN REACTION Nuclear energy is released by way of a fission chain reaction. In this process, which is depicted in Fig. 4.1, neutrons emitted by fissioning nuclei induce fissions in other fissile or fissionable nuclei; the neutrons from these fissions induce fissions in still other fissile or fissionable nuclei; and so on. Such a chain reaction can be described quantitatively in tenns of the multiplication/actor, which is denoted by the symbol k. This is defined as the ratio of the number of fissions (or fission neutrons) in one generation divided by the number of fissions (or fission neutrons) in the preceding generation. In equation fonn, this is number of fissions in one generation k = ---------------------------------number of fissions in preceding generation (4.1) 117

 text: 118 Nuclear Reactors and Nuclear Power Figure 4.1 Schematic representation of fission chain reaction. Chap. 4 If k is greater than 1, then from Eq. (4.1) the number of fissions increases from generation to generation. In this case, the energy released by the chain reac­tion increases with time, and the chain reaction, or the system in which it is taking place, is said to be supercritical. However, if k is less than 1, the number of fissions decreases with time and the chain reaction is called subcritical. Finally, in the spe­cial situation where k is equal to 1, the chain reaction proceeds at a constant rate, energy is released at a steady level, and the system is said to be critical. Devices that are designed so that the fission chain reaction can proceed in a controlled manner are called nuclear reactors. In a reactor, this control is accom­plished by varying the value of k, which can be done by the person operating the system. To increase the power being produced by a reactor, the operator increases k to a value greater than unity so that the reactor becomes supercritical. When the desired power level has been reached, he returns the reactor to critical by adjusting the value of k to be unity, and the reactor then maintains the specified power level. To reduce power or shut the reactor down, the operator merely reduces k, making the reactor subcritical. As a result, the power output of the system decreases. Nu­clear bombs and explosives cannot be controlled in this way, and these devices are not referred to as reactors. Several types of nuclear reactors are described later in this Chapter.

 text: Sec. 4.2 Nuclear Reactor Fuels 119 To make a reactor critical, or otherwise to adjust the value of k, it is neces­sary to balance the rate at which neutrons are produced within the reactor with the rate at which they disappear. Neutrons can disappear in two ways as the result of absorption in some type of nuclear reaction, or by escaping from the surface of the reactor. When the sum of the neutron absorption and leakage rates is exactly equal to the neutron production rate, then the reactor is critical. If the production rate is greater than the sum of the absorption and leakage rates, the reactor is supercrit­ical; conversely, if it is smaller, the reactor is subcritical. As would be expected, the production, absorption, and leakage rates depend on the size and composition of a reactor. It is shown in Chapters 5 and 6 that it is possible to derive accurate analytical relationships between these three rates on the one hand and the size and composition on the other. These relationships determine the dimensions and mate­rial properties necessary for a reactor to be critical. 4.2 NUCLEAR REACTOR FUELS Conversion and Breeding It is recalled from Section 3.7 that TJ fission neutrons are emitted, on the average, per neutron absorbed by a fissile or fissionable nucleus. To become critical, a reac­tor obviously must be fueled with a nuclide having a value of TJ greater than 1. If TJ were less than 1, a fission in one generation would necessarily lead to less than one fission in succeeding generations, and the reactor could never achieve a crit­ical state. However, TJ cannot be exactly 1 since, as already noted, some neutrons inevitably are lost either in nonfission absorption reactions or by escaping from the system altogether, and criticality could not be reached. A check of fission data shows that TJ is, in fact, substantially greater than 1 for the fissile nuclides at all incident neutron energies, and for the fissionable but nonfissile nuclei such as 232Th and 238U well above their fission thresholds. How­ever, with the nonfissile nuclides, only those neutrons in a reactor with energies above the fission threshold are able to induce fission. For a reactor fueled only with fissionable but nonfissile nuclides, the effective value of TJ is equal to the actual value of TJ, multiplied by the fraction of the neutrons absorbed in the reactor with energies above the fission threshold. Regrettably, this number is always less than 1, and it follows that reactors cannot be made critical with nonfissile material alone. Fissile nuclides are therefore essential ingredients in all reactor fuels. Only one fissile nuclide, 235U, is found in nature, where it occurs with an iso­topic abundance of 0.72 a / o. The remainder of natural uranium, except for a trace of 234U, is 238U. Thus, only 1 uranium atom out of 139 is 235U. Despite this low concentration of fissile isotope it is possible to fuel certain types of critical reactors with natural uranium, and all of the early reactors were of this type. However, most

page number: 138
 text: 120 Nuclear Reactors and Nuclear Power Chap. 4 modem reactors require enriched uranium -that is, uranium in which the concen­tration of 235U has been increased over its natural value. Methods for enriching uranium are discussed in Section 4.7. As is the case for any natural resource, the supply of 235U is finite. It is shown in Section 4.6 that the world's resources of235U for nuclear fuel are limited. Indeed, if nuclear power was based on the fission of 235U alone, the era of nuclear energy would be a comparatively short one-probably not more than a century in dura­tion. Fortunately, it is possible to manufacture certain fissile isotopes from abun­dant nonfissile material, a process known as conversion. The two most important fissile isotopes that can be produced by conversion are 233U and 239Pu. The 233U is obtained from thorium by the absorption of neutrons. The reactions involved are as follows: (4.2) As the result of the reactions in Eq. (4.2), the nonfissile isotope 232Th is converted into fissile 233U. Isotopes like 232Th, which are not fissile but from which fissile isotopes can be produced by neutron absorption, are said to be fertile. It is a relatively simple matter to bring about the reactions given in Eq. (4.2). Naturally occurring thorium is entirely 232Th. Therefore, it is merely necessary to introduce thorium, in one form or another, into a critical reactor where it is exposed to neutrons. After a suitable irradiation time, when the 233U has built up to a desired level, the thorium is withdrawn from the reactor and the 233U is extracted from the thorium. This can be done by chemical means since thorium and uranium are two entirely different chemical elements. With one exception (see Section 4.5), however, comparatively little 233U has been produced from thorium since there is almost no demand for 233U as a reactor fuel. Nevertheless, thorium remains an important potential source of nuclear fuel. 239pu is obtained from reactions similar to Eq. (4.2)-namely, 238U(n, y)239U � 239Np � 239PU. (4.3) The fertile isotope in this case is the 238U; 239Np is the intermediate nucleus. To realize these reactions in practice, 238U must be irradiated in a reactor. This, how­ever, occurs automatically in most power reactors of current design. Thus, as noted earlier, most present-day reactors are fueled with uranium that is only slightly en­riched in 235U. Practicaliy all of the fuel in these reactors is 238U, and the conversion of 238U to 239pU takes place as a matter of course during the normal operation of these reactors. The plutonium is later extracted chemically from the fuel, uranium and plutonium being different elements. The chemical extraction of fissile material from fertile material is calledjUeZ reprocessing and is described in Section 4.8. After 239Pu has been formed in a reactor, it may absorb a neutron and un­dergo fission or be transformed into 240pU. The 240pU, which is not fissile, may in

page number: 139
 text: Sec. 4.2 Nuclear Reactor Fuels 121 tum capture another neutron to produce the fissile isotope 241 Pu. Finally, the 241 Pu may undergo fission or be transformed into 242Pu. Thus, the plutonium extracted from reactor fuel by reprocessing contains, in decreasing amounts, the isotopes 239pu, 240pu, 241 Pu, and 242pU. The fractional content of each isotope depends on the bumup of the fuel, defined later in this section, at the time of reprocessing. The conversion process is described quantitatively in terms of the parameter C, which is called the conversion ratio or sometimes the breeding ratio. This is defined as the average number of fissile atoms produced in a reactor per fissile fuel atom consumed. Thus, when N atoms of fuel are consumed, N C atoms of fertile material are converted into new fissile atoms. However, if the newly produced fis­sile isotope is the same as the isotope that fuels the reactor, the new atoms may later be consumed to convert another NC x C = NC2 atoms of fertile material; these may be consumed to convert NC3 fertile atoms; and so on. In this way, it is easy to see that the consumption of N fuel atoms results in the conversion of a total of NC 1-C fertile atoms, provided C is less than 1. When C = 1, an infinite amount of fertile material can be converted starting with a given amount of fuel. Example 4.1 In a critical reactor fueled with natural uranium, it is observed that, for every neu­ tron absorbed in 235U, 0.254 neutrons are absorbed in resonances of 238U and 0.640 neutrons are absorbed by 238U at thennal energies. There is essentially no leakage of neutrons from the reactor. (a) What is the conversion ratio for the reactor? (b) How much 239 Pu in kilograms is produced when I kg of 235U is consumed? Solution. 1. Each absorption of a neutron by 238U, whether at resonance or thermal en­ ergies, produces an atom of 239pu via reaction Eq. (4.3). Furthennore, each time a neutron is absorbed by a 235U nucleus, that nucleus is consumed. The compound nucleus either undergoes fission or emits a y-ray to become 236U. Thus, the total number of 239pU atoms produced per 235U atom consumed is 0.254 + 0.640 = 0.894. This, by definition, is the value of the conversion factor, so that C = 0.894. [Ans.] 2. The consumption of I kg of 235U involves the disappearance by neutron ab­ sorption of 1,000NA/235 atoms of 235U, where NA is Avogadro's number. From the definition of C, this is accompanied by the production of C x 1000N A/235 atoms of 239pu, which have a total mass of C x 1000 x 239/235 gore x 239/235 kg. Thus, the consumption of I kg of 235U leads in this

page number: 140
 text: 122 Nuclear Reactors and Nuclear Power Chap. 4 example to the production of 239 0.894 x 235 = 0.909 kg of 239Pu.[Ans.] A most important situation occurs when C is greater than 1. In this case, more than one fissile atom is produced for every fissile atom consumed, which is a process described as breeding. Reactors that are designed so that breeding will take place are called breeder reactors or simply breeders. Reactors that convert but do not breed are called converters; reactors that neither convert nor breed but simply consume fuel are called burners. Breeders are remarkable devices for, in addition to providing power through the energy released in fission, they actually produce more fissile fuel than they consume. Needless to say, it is more difficult to design a reactor that will breed than one that merely converts. For one thing, while 11 must be greater than 1 for conversion, it must be greater than 2 for breeding. This is because, in any reactor, one fission neutron must eventually be absorbed in fuel just to keep the reactor critical and maintain the chain reaction. If the reactor is to breed, more than one neutron must be absorbed in fertile material to produce the new fissile isotope. In actual fact, 11 must be substantially greater than 2 for, as noted earlier, in any reactor some neutrons inevitably are absorbed by nonfuel atoms or lost by leakage. In this connection, it is important to recognize that 11 is not a constant, but depends on the energy of the neutron that induces the fission. This variation of 11 with neutron energy is shown in Fig. 4.2 for the three fissile isotopes 233U, 235U, and 239Pu. At thermal neutron energies (i.e., E � 0.025 eV), the value of 11 for 233U is about 2.29, which is sufficiently in excess of 2 for breeding to be possible. Thus, a properly designed reactor in which most of the fissions are induced by thermal neutrons-that is, a thermal reactor---c ould breed if it were fueled with 233U. By contrast, the thermal neutron values of 11 for 235U and 239pu, 2.07 and 2.14, respectively, are not sufficiently greater than 2 to permit breeding. Returning to Fig. 4.2, it is observed that in the intermediate energy range, from about 1 eV to 100 keY for 235U and from about 10 eV to 20 keY for 239pu, the value of 11 falls below 2. Breeding cannot be achieved when these isotopes are used to fuel a reactor in which most of the fissions occur at these energies. It has now been demonstrated that such an intermediate reactor can be made to breed, at least in a limited way, when fueled with 233U. The value of 11 for 233U is greater than 2 by a sufficient margin at intermediate energies to make breeding possible (see the LWBR discussion in Section 4.5). Above about 100 ke V, as indicated in Fig. 4.2, 11 rises to values substantially above 2 for all three of the fissile fuels. As far as the value of 11 is concerned, it should therefore be possible to breed with these fuels provided the reactor is designed in such a way that the bulk of the fissions are induced by neutrons with

Reactors of this type are called fast reactors or, since they are usually designed to breed, fast breeders. It must be noted that, although the value of 1] for 235U is high enough for breeding, unfortunately there is no fertile material in nature that can be converted into 235U. Thus, although a fast reactor fueled with 235U may produce more 239Pu from 238U than the 235U it consumes, the 235U is used up forever. Some fast breeders, in the absence of an initial supply of plutonium, have been started with 235U fuel, but they are ultimately fueled with plutonium. This fuel is also preferred over 233U because of its higher value of 1]. Thus, fast breeders are almost always fueled with plutonium. The extent to which breeding occurs in a reactor is described by the breeding gain-a parameter denoted by the symbol G. This is defined asthe net increase in the number of fissile atoms in a reactor per fuel atom consumed. Since C, the breeding ratio, is the total number of fuel atoms produced per fuel atom consumed, it follows that G and C are simply related by G=C-l. Suppose that C = 1.2. This means that 1.2 new atoms of fuel are produced for each atom consumed. The net increase in the number of fuel atoms per atom consumed is then clearly 0.2, and the breeding gain is 0.2.

 text: Sec. 4.2 Nuclear Reactor Fuels 125 Breeding is also described in terms of the doubling time. This is defined as the hypothetical time interval during which the amount of fissile material in (or associated with) a reactor doubles. To compute the doubling time, suppose that a reactor is operated at a constant thermal power level of Po megawatts. This reac­tor consumes fissile material at the uniform rate of w Po grams per day, where w is the fuel consumption rate per unit power. (In the case of a 235U-fueled reactor according to Section 3.7 w = 1.23 g per day per thermal megawatt.) This is equiv­alent to the consumption of wPoNAI M f atoms of fuel, where NA is Avogadro's number and M f is the atomic weight of the fuel. From the earlier definition of G, the consumption of w PoN AI M f fuel atoms produces Gw PoN A 1M f atoms of fuel over and above those consumed, which means that there is a net production rate of Gw Po grams of fuel per day. 1 If none of this new fuel is removed from the reactor, the total amount of fuel in the system will increase linearly with time from the ini­tial fuel inventory mo. The linear doubling time is defined as the time tDl required for the total amount of fuel in the reactor to reach the value 2mo. Clearly then, and GwPo x tDl = mo mo tDl = --. GwPo (4.4) It is not difficult to see that permitting all of the newly produced fuel to ac­cumulate in the reactor is a wasteful procedure. The extra fuel is not required to keep the reactor operating and could better be removed and, together with fuel from other breeders, be used to fuel another breeding reactor. In this way, the total power produced from all the fuel can be increased as the fuel mass increases in both the original and second breeder. This mode of operation also coincides more closely with actual practice since breeder reactors are refueled at regular intervals (normally about once or twice every 2 years) over their lifetime. It can be shown (see Problem 6.8) that the reactor power which can be pro­duced from a given fuel mass is proportional to the mass-that is, P = 13m, (4.5) where {3 is a constant. However, as shown earlier, the rate of increase in mass is given by dm -=GwP dt ' IThis assumes that the newly produced fuel and the fuel consumed have the same atomic weight. If they are different, the production rate must be multiplied by the ratio of their atomic weights.

(4.9) The growth in total fuel inventory and the two doubling times, tD/ and tDe, are shown in Fig. 4.3. In practice, both tD/ and tDe have been used. However, because 2rno rno Figure 4.3 Growth in the inventory of flIel by breeding "meier two conditions: (a) new fuel continually extracted and used for further breeding, (b) new fuel left in reactor.

 text: Sec. 4.2 Nuclear Reactor Fuels 127 tDe reflects a more usual mode of fuel managment, it is frequently referred to as the doubling time. It should be emphasized that the actual time required by a reactor owner to double his inventory of fissile material is greater than either of the doubling times computed previously, since the time required to remove the newly produced fuel from the reactor and have it chemically separated and fabricated into a fonn suit­able for fueling the reactor was omitted in the derivation. Nevertheless, the dou­bling time is a reasonable measure of merit for the perfonnance of a breeder. Thus, all other things being equal (which they never are), the best breeder is clearly the one with the lowest value of tDe. Example 4.2 A hypothetical fast breeder reactor is fueled with a mixture of 239pu and 238U. When operating at full power, the plutonium is consumed at a rate of approximately 1 kg per day. The reactor contains 500 kg of 239pu at its initial startup, and the breeding gain is 0.15. (a) At what rate is 239Pu being produced? (b) Calculate the linear and exponential doubling times of this reactor. Solution. 1. From the definition of breeding gain, the reactor produces 0.15 extra atoms of 239Pu for every atom of 239Pu consumed. On a per kilogram basis, this means that the reactor produces 0.15 additional kilograms of 239Pu for each kilogram consumed. Since the consumption rate of 239pU is 1 kg/day, it follows that the instantaneous rate of plutonium production is 0.15 kg/day or about 55 kg/yr. [Ans.J 2. The factor w Po in Eq. (4.4) is the total fuel consumption rate, which is 1 kg/day in this problem. From that equation, it follows that 500kg 500 kg tDl = = = 9.1 yr.[Ans.] 0.15 kg/day 55 kg/yr Then from Eq. (4.9), tDe = 0.693 x 9.1 = 6.3 yr. [Ans.J Nuclear Fuel Performance-Burn up and Specific Burnup The total energy released in fission by a given amount of nuclear fuel is called the fuel bumup and is measured in megawatt days (MW d). The fission energy released per unit mass of the fuel is tenned the specific bumup of the fuel and is usually expressed in megawatt days per metric ton or per kilogram (that is, MWdlt or MWd/kg) of the heavy metal originally contained in the fuel. According to the discussion in Section 3.7, the fissioning of 1.05 g of 235U yields 1 MWd. Thus, it

page number: 146
 text: 128 Nuclear Reactors and Nuclear Power Chap. 4 follows that the maximum theoretical bumup for this fuel is or 950 MW d/kg. 1 MWd 106 g --- X -- = 950,000 MWdlt 1.05 g t Fuel performance is also described in terms of fractional burnup (often ex­pressed in %), denoted as f3 and defined as the ratio of the number of fissions in a specified mass of fuel to the total number of heavy atoms originally in the fuel. That is, number of fissions fj = initial number of heavy atoms' (4.10) Since the fission of all fuel atoms (fj = 1) yields 950,000 MW dlt and the specific bumup at any time is clearly proportional to fj, it follows that, for 235U, specific bumup = 950, OOOfjMWdlt. (4.11) The maximum specific bumup that can be obtained from a given reactor fuel depends on a number of factors, which are discussed in Section 7.5. Example 4.3 A thermal reactor is loaded with 98 metric tons of uranium dioxide (U02) fuel in which the uranium is enriched to 3 w/o 235U. The reactor operates at a power level of 3,300 MW for 750 days before it is shut down for refueling. (a) What is the specific bumup of the fuel at shutdown? (b) What is the fractional bumup at shutdown? Solution. 1. The total bumup of the fuel is 3,300 x 750 = 2.48 x 106 MWd. The atomic weight of 3 w /0 uranium is approximately 238. Therefore, of the 98 t of U02, 98 x 238/(238 + 2 x 16) = 86.4 t is uranium, that is, the heavy metal. The specific bumup is then 2.48 x 106/86.4 = 28, 700 MWdlt. [Ans.] 2. From Eq. (4.11), the fractional burnup is 28, 700 f3 = 950,000 = 0.0302 = 3.02%. [Ans.] [Note. In any reactor like the one in this example, which is fueled with low­ enriched uranium, the bulk of the fuel is 238U. Some of the 238U is converted to the isotopes ()f plutonium as the reactor operate s, and a portion of the plutonium fissions in the reactor. Some 238U also undergoes fission by interactions with fast neutrons, Over 40% of the fissions in such a reactor may actually occur in non_235U atoms. This explains why f3 in the present case is larger than the fuel enrichment of 3 w /0. In fact, the spent fuel may still have a 235U enrichment on the order of 1 W /0 at unloading. ]

 text: Sec. 4.3 Non-Nuclear Compone nts of Nuclear Power Plants 129 For convenience, the fissile and fertile nuclides are frequently identified by a simple numerical code that was introduced during the Manhattan Project of World War II. Suppose that the atomic number Z and atomic mass number A of some nuclide are denoted by Z = ab and A = cde, where a, b, and so on are digits. Then according to the code, the nuclide in question is identified by the two-digit number be. Thus, 235U is "25," 238U is "28," 239pu is "49," 241 Pu is "41," and so on. This code often simplifies notation and is used throughout this book. 4.3 NON-NUCLEAR COMPONEN TS OF NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS Since the world's first reactor (an assembly of natural uranium lumps imbedded in graphite) was brought to critical in Chicago on December 2, 1942, a large number of reactors have been designed and built for a variety of purposes: for the conver­sion of 238U to 239pu; for the propUlsion of ships, aircraft, rockets, and satellites; for medical irradiation; for research; and for the generation of electrical power. It is impossible herein to describe all of these reactors in detail. Instead, attention is focused on reactors in the last category-namely, reactors that are used in station­ary power plants for the generation of electricity. Most nuclear engineers today are employed in one way or another with the nuclear electric power industry. In all nuclear power plants, the fission energy released in the reactor is used to produce steam-either directly in the reactor or in auxiliary heat exchangers called steam generators. The reactor or reactor-steam generator combination is called the nuclear steam supply system (NSSS). The NSSS serves the same function as the steam boiler in a conventional fossil-fuel plant. The way in which the steam is utilized in a power plant is considered in the present section; reactors and nuclear steam supply systems are discussed in the next two sections. Figure 4.4 schematically shows the steam system in a nuclear power plant from the point where the steam leaves the reactor or steam generators to the point where it returns as feedwater to be reconverted into steam. As indicated in the figure, the steam is used to drive steam turbines, which are coupled to a generator to produce electricity. Turbines, in principle at least, are simple machines. They consist of a series of bladed wheels affixed to an axle, which rotates at high speed as steam at high temperature and pressure strikes the turbine blades. Steam, of course, is just the gaseous form of water, and it does not contain any liquid water per se. To emphasize this, steam is often referred to as dry steam; steam mixed with liquid water is called wet steam. Steam is always delivered to a turbine as dry as possible, but as it passes through successive turbine stages, its temperature and pressure are reduced, and some of the steam is condensed to droplets of liquid water. It has been found that these droplets impinging on the turbine blades lead to excessive erosion of the blades and hence to reduced turbine lifetime. In addition,

This problem can be circumvented in a number of ways. It is recalled from thermodynamics that water is converted to steam by adding heat (the latent heat of vaporization) to water at constant pressure and temperature. The steam so produced is said to be saturated. The extraction of any energy from such saturated steam, as occurs when it passes through a turbine, results in the condensation of some of the steam to liquid water. However, if the steam is heated above the temperature at which it was evolved from boiling water, some heat can be extracted without condensation taking place. Steam that has been heated in this way is said to be superheated. By superheating the steam before it enters a turbine, the total amount of water produced in the turbine can be significantly reduced. Superheating may be done in a separate unit designed for the purpose, in a portion of the steam generator, or in the reactor. Another approach to this problem is to remove the wet steam from the turbine when the water content has reached a specified level (separate the steam from the water, which is done in a moisture separator), reheat this spent steam using the higher pressure and hotter steam from the reactor or steam generators, and pass the reheated steam (which may be superheated at this point) to one or more lower pressure turbines as shown in Fig. 4.4. Moisture separation and reheating is usually performed in the same device-one for each low-pressure turbine. The wet steam passes over metal blades that draw off the water; then as dry steam, it passes around a series of tubes carrying the hotter NSSS steam. Reheating is utilized in fossil as well as nuclear power plants. From the low-pressure turbines, the spent steam passes into a condenser, where it is cooled by water from a suitable outside source, and the steam is con-

 text: Sec. 4.3 Non-Nuclear Componen ts of Nuclear Power Plants 131 densed to water. In this part of the steam cycle, heat is rejected by the system. This rejection of heat is an essential part of the operation of the plant from a thermody­namic point of view. Thus, it is not possible to skip the condenser portion of the cycle and return the spent steam directly to the reactor side of the system. To do so would violate the second law of thermodynamics, which forbids the extraction of heat from any source and the performance of an equivalent amount of work in a cyclical process. The condensed water, or condensate, is next pumped through a demineralizer and then back to the steam-producing side of the cycle as feedwater. It turns out that the overall efficiency of the system is increased if the feedwater is heated by steam withdrawn from an intermediate stage in the turbine, which is a procedure known as regeneration. This heating takes place in the feedwater heaters, shown in Fig. 4.4. These are heat exchangers with turbine steam on the hot side. With the feedwater heated and returned to the reactor or steam generator, the power­producing portion of the steam cycle is complete. The overall efficiency of a nuclear power plant is defined as the ratio W eff= -, QR (4.12) where W is the rate of electrical energy output in megawatts (denoted by MWe), and QR is the rate of thermal energy output from the reactor (written as MWt). The value of W is less than QR by an amount equal to the sum of the heat losses in all parts of the system-that is, energy lost in the various heat exchangers, the turbines, pumps, piping, the generator, and also the heat, Q c, rejected to the coolant in the condenser. In practice, virtually all of the recoverable energy of fission is converted into the steam, which enters the turbine. Relatively little energy is lost in the turbine or piping or is required to operate the various pumps, and the generator performs at high efficiency. It follows that, as a rough approximation, Equation (4.12) can then be written as Qc eff::::l--. QR (4.13) (4.14) It follows from this equation that the smaller the value of Qc, the greater the ef­ficiency of the plant-or, conversely, the greater the efficiency of the plant, the smaller the amount of heat Q c rejected to the condenser cooling water for a given plant capacity. In practice, the efficiency of a steam cycle of the type described earlier de­pends on many parameters, among which are the temperature Tt of the steam en­tering the turbine and the temperature Tc of the coolant used in the condenser. In

 text: 132 Nuclear Reactors and Nuclear Power Chap. 4 particular, the efficiency increases with increasing Tr and with decreasing Tc. For an actual plant, the value of Tc is determined by the environmental conditions, lo­cal air temperature, or the temperature of the condenser cooling water, and only the value of Tt is under the control of the plant designer. To achieve high efficiency, therefore, it is necessary to operate the turbine with steam at the highest possible temperature. Plant efficiency is an important consideration for both nuclear and fossil fuel plants, but for somewhat different reasons. With fossil fuel plants, the cost of pro­ducing electricity is largely determined by the cost of the fuel, which is consumed in large quantity to provide the heat QR.1t follows from Eq. (4.12) that with higher plant efficiency less fuel must be consumed to produce a given amount of elec­trical power. Therefore, every effort is made in fossil fuel plants to produce high­temperature steam, and turbines in these plants are operated close to the maximum temperature permitted by the metallurgical properties of the turbine materials. In contrast, with nuclear power plants, the cost of electricity is largely de­termined by capital costs (specifically, the interest charges on the money used to build the plant) and not by fuel costs. Thus, electricity can be produced econom­ically in a nuclear plant even if its efficiency is low and fuel consumption is high simply because the cost of electricity is not significantly influenced by fuel costs in the first place. This is a fortunate circumstance for the nuclear industry since it is not possible to produce high-temperature steam, comparable to that used in fossil fuel plants, in many of the nuclear systems currently available. This, in tum, is due to the fact that the temperature of the fuel used in these reactors is restricted to relatively low values-lower, for example, than the temperature of the combustion chamber in a conventional boiler. Such low fuel temperatures are necessary to en­sure the integrity of the fuel and make certain that the fission products produced within the fuel remain confined. However, there is at least one serious consequence of the low efficiency of most present-day nuclear installations-namely, as shown in Eq. (4.14), they nec­essarily reject more heat to the environment than comparable fossil fuel plants. For example, a nuclear plant operating at an overall efficiency of 33% can be shown (see Problem 4.16) to eject approximately 25% more heat to the environment than a fossil fuel plant with an efficiency of 38%. If this heat is improperly discharged to a body of water or if the body of water is too small for the amount of heat re­jected, then the ensuing temperature rise of the water may upset the equilibrium of biological species residing there, and this can lead to the deterioration and eventual stagnation of the water source. This phenomenon is called thennal pollution. It is an important consideration both in the siting and in design of all power plants, but especially nuclear power plants. To reduce thermal pollution, many nuclear power plants utilize cooling towers. These are large structures (often over 500 ft high) in which heat is exchanged between the condenser cooling water and the atmosphere. In this way, the heat from the condenser is absorbed by the atmosphere instead of

 text: Sec. 4.4 Componen ts of Nuclear Reactors 133 being rejected to a local body of water. Cooling towers must also be used wherever an adequate supply of cooling water cannot be guaranteed year-round. In addition to efficiency, two other parameters are used to describe the perfor­mance of a nuclear power plant (or any type of power plant for that matter). These are the availability and capacity factors. The availability is defined as the percent of time, over any given reporting period, that the plant is operational-that is, either in operation or capable of being put into operation if the electrical demand requires it. The capacity factor is the percent of the total electrical power that could the­oretically be produced during a specified period if the plant were operated at full power 100% of the time. The capacity factor is less than (or possibly equal to) the availability because a plant cannot be operated if it is not available, and because it is not always operated at full power when it is available due to the vagaries of electrical demand and the economics of utility operation. The availability of American-built light-water nuclear plants (see Section 4.5) is in the neighborhood of 90%, about the same as fossil fired plants. The capacity factors of these nuclear plants generally lie between 80% and 85%. Both the avail­ability and capacity factors of Canadian-built heavy water reactor plants are higher. Example 4.4 Over a period of 1 year a nuclear power plant with an output rating of 1,075 MWe actually delivers 255,000 MWd of electric power to the utility grid. During this time, the plant was down-that is, inoperable-28 days for refueling, 45 days for repairs to the nuclear portions of the plant, and 18 days for repairs to the conventional portions of the plant. (a) What was the plant capacity factor during the year? (b) What was the plant availability? Solution. 1. At full power for the entire year (365 days), the plant could deliver 1075 x 365 = 392,375 MWd. Since it only delivered 255,000 MWd, the capacity factor is 255,000/392,375 = 0.65 = 65%. [Ans.] 2. The total number of days the plant was down is 28 + 45 + 18 91. It was therefore operable 365 -91 = 274 days. The plant availability is then 274/365 = 0.75 = 75%. [Ans.] 4.4 COMPONENTS OF NUCLEAR REACTORS Before discussing specific reactors for the generation of steam, it is helpful to first review the principal component parts or regions of typical reactors. These are shown in Fig. 4.5. It must be emphasized that this drawing is merely schematic and does not depict an actual reactor.

 text: 134 Nuclear Reactors and Nuclear Power Chap. 4 Containment Figure 4.5 Schematic drawing of the principal components of a nu­ clear reactor together with the radiation shield and containment. The central region of a reactor shown in Fig. 4.5 is called the core.2 In a thennal reactor, the core contains the fuel, the moderator, and a coolant. In a fast breeder reactor, there is no moderator, only fuel and coolant. The fuel includes the fissile isotope that, as explained earlier, is responsible for both the criticality of the reactor and the release of fission energy. However, the fuel may also contain large amounts of fertile material. Indeed, most modem power reactors (which are thennal) are fueled with uranium enriched to only a few percent 235U, so that most of the fuel is actually 238U. The moderator, which is only present in thennal reactors, is used to mod­ erate-that is, to slow down-the neutrons from fission to thermal energies. It was shown in Section 3.5 that nuclei with low-mass numbers are most effective for this purpose, so the moderator is always a low-mass-number material. Water (two-thirds of atoms of which are hydrogen), heavy water, and graphite (the com­mon fonn of carbon) are often used as moderators. Beryllium and beryllium oxide (BeO), a white ceramic material, have been used occasionally, but they are very costly. The coolant, as the name implies, is used to remove the heat from the core and other parts of the reactor where heat may be produced. Water, heavy water, and various gases are the most commonly used coolants for thennal reactors. In the case of water and heavy water, these coolants also frequently serve as the moderator. 2The core of a breeder reactor is often called the driver since this is the part of the reactor that leads to the criticality of the reactor-h ence drives the system.

page number: 153
 text: Sec. 4.4 Componen ts of Nuclear Reactors 135 With fast reactors, water and heavy water cannot be used as coolants, at least in liquid fonn, since these materials would tend to slow down the fission neutrons, which, in this type of reactor, must be kept as energetic as possible. Most fast reactors are cooled by liquid sodium. Sodium has excellent heat transfer properties; with an atomic weight of 23, it is not effective in slowing down neutrons by elastic scattering. (However, some moderation occurs as a result of inelastic scattering.) Gases, of course, can also be used to cool fast reactors. Surrounding the core of breeder reactors is a region of fertile material called the blanket. This region is designed specifically for conversion or breeding. Neu­trons that escape from the core are intercepted in the blanket and enter into the various conversion reactions. However, a substantial amount of power may also be produced in the blanket as the result of fissions induced by fast neutrons, so it must be cooled as well as the core. The region adjacent to the core, or to the blanket if one is present, is called the reflector. This is a thickness of moderating material whose function can be understood in the following way. Suppose the core (or blanket) were bare-that is, open and exposed to the air. In this case, all of the neutrons that escaped from the surface of the core would be lost from the reactor-none would return. By placing a region of moderator around the reactor, however, some of these neutrons are returned to the core or blanket after one or more collisions in the reflector. All of the neutrons do not return, of course, but some do, thus saving neutrons for the chain reaction. It is shown later in this book that reflectors significantly reduce the amount of fuel required to make a reactor critical. The control rods shown in Fig. 4.5 are movable pieces of neutron-absorbing material; as their name suggests, they are used to control the reactor. Since they absorb neutrons, any movement of the rods affects the multiplication factor of the system. Withdrawal of the rods increases k, whereas insertion decreases k. Thus, the reactor can be started up or shut down, or its power output can be changed by the appropriate motion of the rods. Control rods must also be adjusted to keep a reactor critical and operating at a specified power level, when, in the course of time, the fuel is consumed and various neutron-absorbing fission products accumulate in the reactor. Several materials have been used for control rods: boron steel, since boron has a high neutron absorption cross-section; hafnium or cadmium, metallic elements that are strong thennal neutron absorbers; silver; and various alloys of these metals. The rods may be cylindrical in shape (rods, in the true sense of the word) or may be sheets, blades, or crossed blades, which are called cruciform rods. The various reactor components just described are all located within the reac­ tor vessel, which, if the components are under pressure, is also called the pressure vessel. To reduce the thermal stresses in the reactor vessel caused by the absorp­tion of y-rays emanating from the core, it is necessary in some reactors to place a thermal shield, a thick layer of y-rays absorbing material (usually iron or steel), between the reflector and the inner wall of the vessel. Since the thermal shield

page number: 154
 text: 136 Nuclear Reactors and Nuclear Power Chap. 4 absorbs considerable energy, it ordinarily must be cooled along with the core and blanket. The reactor vessel and all other components of the nuclear steam supply sys­tem that contain sources of radiation are surrounded by radiation shielding in vary­ing amounts for the protection of plant personnel during normal operation of the reactor; the amount of shielding varies according to the design of the reactor. To protect the general public from the consequences of a reactor accident-in particu­lar, one involving the release of fission products from the reactor-the entire reac­tor installation is enclosed in a containment structure. In some plants, this takes the form of a heavily constructed building housing the entire nuclear steam supply sys­tem; in other installations, the containment is split, with a portion surrounding the reactor (the primary containment), and the remainder coinciding with the reactor building (the secondary containment). In addition to the several components illustrated in Fig. 4.5, elaborate safety systems, some of which are described in Chapter 11, must be included in a nu­clear power plant for use in emergencies. Provisions must also be made for the loading of fuel and storage of radioactive spent fuel prior to its shipment from the plant. Various sensing devices must be located at several points inside and outside the reactor vessel to monitor the operation of the system. Finally, a considerable amount of structural material is necessary to give support and integrity to the plant. It should be clear that nuclear power plants are complex installations and, by their nature, must be designed with care. 4.5 POWER REACTORS AND NUCLEAR STEAM SUPPLY SYSTEMS In the relatively short history of nuclear power, many types of reactors have been proposed for the production of steam. The present discussion is confined to those nuclear steam supply systems that are currently in use or that hold promise of being adopted in the future. Section 4.6 shows that, because of the limited resources of 235U, the nu­clear power industry in time will undoubtedly have to shift to the breeder reactor. Present-day reactors that do not breed should be recognized as interim systems, pending the introduction of breeders during the next century. Power reactor systems consist primarily of five types of reactors: (a) pres­surized water reactors and boiling water, which produce steam directly in the eore and are the mainstay of the nuclear power industry; (b) evolutionary pressurized water reactors, which have the basic elements of pressurized water reactors but with many significant improvements; (c) evolutionary boiling water reactors; (d) heavy-water moderated reactors; and (e) gas-cooled reactors.

 text: Sec. 4.5 Power Reactors and Nuclear Steam Supply Systems 137 Reactors The pressurized water and boiling water reactors fall into the general class of light­ water reactors since they use ordinary or light water for the coolant and moderator. The heavy water reactor, as the name implies, uses 020 for the moderator, whereas the gas-cooled reactors use a solid such as carbon for the moderator and a gas such as helium for the coolant. Light-Water Reactors The most widely used reactor in the world today for producing electric power is the thennal reactor, which is moderated, reflected, and cooled by ordinary (light) water. As noted earlier, water has excellent mod­erating properties. In addition, its thennodynamic properties are well understood, and it is readily available at little cost. However, water has a high vapor pressure, which means that light-water reactors (LWRs) must be operated at high pressures. Water also absorbs thennal neutrons to such an extent that it is not possible to fuel a LWR with natural uranium-it simply would never become critical. Uranium in water reactors must always be enriched, at least to some extent. There are basically two types of light-water reactors now in use: the pres­surized-water reactor (PWR) and the boiling-water reactor (BWR). Both of these types of reactors are well established in the United States and abroad, and both produce power about as cheaply as comparable coal-fired plants. The Pressuri zed-Water Reactor The PWR was one of the first types of power reactors developed commercially in the United States. This reactor has also become standard on nuclear-powered ships and naval vessels throughout the world. Figure 4.6 shows a cross-sectional view of a typical PWR. As indicated in the figure, water enters the pressure vessel at a temperature of about 290°C or 554°F, flows down around the outside of the core where it serves as a reflector, passes upward through the core where it is heated, and then exits from the vessel with a temperature of about 325°C or 617°F. The water in a PWR is maintained at a high pressure-approximately 15 MPa or 2250 psi. At this pressure, the water will not boil, at least not to any great extent. Since the water does not boil in the reactor, the steam for the turbines must be produced external to the reactor. This is done in steam generators, which are heat exchangers with pressurized water on the hot side. A typical steam generator is shown in Fig. 4.7. High-pressure, heated coolant water from the reactor enters at the bottom and passes upward and then downward through several thousand tubes each in the shape of an inverted U. The outer surfaces of these tubes are in contact with lower pressure and cooler feed water returning from the turbine condenser. Heat transferred from the hot water inside the tubes causes the feed water to boil and produce steam. The lower section of a steam generator where this boiling occurs

The wet steam produced in the evaporator passes upward into a portion of the steam generator known as the steam drum section. Here the steam is dried in various moisture separators before exiting to the turbines. Steam generators are also manufactured with straight tubes rather than U tubes. Large PWR systems utilize as many as four steam generators, which produce steam

 text: 140 Nuclear Reactors and Nuclear Power Chap. 4 at about 293°C or 560°F and 5 MPa or 750 psi. This gives an overall efficiency of between 32% and 33% for a PWR plant. Because water is essentially incompressible, even small changes in coolant volume could lead to large changes in pressure, which could have deleterious ef­fects on the system. For instance, if for any reason the coolant volume were de­creased, the subsequent drop in pressure could result in the vaporization of some of the water in the reactor; this in turn could lead to the burnout of some of the fuel elements. To prevent this from happening, one coolant loop of a PWR is equipped with a pressure-maintaining surge tank known as a pressurizer. As indicated in Fig. 4.8, a pressurizer consists of a tank, containing steam and water in its upper and lower sections, respectively, with a pressure-actuated spray nozzle at the top and pressure-actuated immersion-type heaters at the bottom. The device operates in the following way. Suppose that the power output of the turbine is reduced in response to a drop in the electrical load on the plant. This leads to a temporary increase in the average temperature of the reactor coolant and a corresponding increase in coolant volume. The expansion of the coolant raises the water level in the pressurizer, which raises the pressure of the steam and actuates the valves to the spray nozzle. Water from one of the cold legs of the reactor coolant system sprays into the top portion of the pressurizer and condenses some of the steam. This quenching action reduces the pressure and limits the pressure rise. When the electrical load is increased instead, the attendant decrease in coolant volume drops the water level and reduces the pressure in the pressurizer. This, in turn, causes some of the water to flash to steam, again limiting the pressure change. At the same time, the pressure drop actuates the heater to further limit the pressure reduction. The major components of a PWR steam supply system are shown in Fig. 4.9. It should be noted that there are four coolant pumps, one for each coolant loop, but only one pressurizer for the entire system. The fuel in PWR reactors is slightly enriched (from 2 to 5 W /0 uranium diox­ide, V02, which is a black ceramic material with a high melting point of approx­imately 2, 800°C or 5,070°F). The V02 is in the form of small cylindrical pellets, about 1 cm in diameter and 2 cm long, which are usually concave on the ends. The pellets are loaded into sealed stainless steel or Zircaloy3 tubes about 4 m long. At the operating temperature of the fuel, the pellets expand axially and fill the void spaces between the pellets. The result is a solidly packed fuel rod or fuel pin. In addition to providing support for the fuel pellets, the Zircaloy fuel tubes also prevent the escape to the passing coolant of fission products, especially fission product gases, that are released from the pellets during the operation of the reactor. 3Zircaloy is an alloy of zirconium, a metal with a small neutron absorption cross-section con­ taining small amounts of tin, iron, chromium, and nickel. There are two forms of Zircaloy that have been used in LWRs-Zircaloy-2 and Zircaloy-4; the latter contains no nickel.

 text: 142 Nuclear Reactors and Nuclear Power Figure 4.9 Schematic arrangement of the major components of a PWR steam supply system. Chap. 4 In this context, the fuel tubes are also known as fuel cladding. PWR fuel of the type described here is nominally capable of delivering about 30 MW d per kg of contained uranium before it must be replaced. Advanced fuels developed in recent years are capable of extended operation because of higher enrichment and the use of gadolinium as a control element during initial operation. Such fuel systems have enrichments as high as 5 W /0 and can achieve 45 MW d per kg. On a few occasions, it has been observed that some fuel pellets, although ex­panding initially as the fuel reaches its operating temperature, later contract due to a gradual increase in the density of the uranium dioxide and corresponding reduction in its specific volume (cm3 /g). This densification of the fuel, as the phenomenon is called, is evidently caused by the migration and combination of small voids within the ceramic. The decrease in the pellet volume leaves void spaces within the fuel tubes. Because of the high pressure of the moderator coolant, this produces large

page number: 161
 text: Sec. 4.5 Power Reactors and Nuclear Steam Supply Systems 143 stresses across the fuel tubes, increasing the likelihood of fuel-tube rupture. To circumvent this problem, the fuel tubes are pressurized with helium at about 3.4 MPa. As fission product gases accumulate in the tubes over the life of the core, the pressure in the tubes gradually builds up to about 14 MPa near the end of the core life. The completed, pressurized fuel rods are next arranged in a square lattice structure called a fuel assembly, one of which is shown in Fig. 4.10; the fuel as­semblies are then arranged in a near-cylindrical array to form the core. The fuel rods in the fuel assemblies are kept apart by various spacers. This is important since rods that come into contact may overheat and release fission products. Control of the PWR is accomplished by the use of control rods, which nor­mally enter the core from the top (see Fig. 4.6), and a chemical shim system. In this latter system, which is discussed more fully in Chapter 7, the value of the mul­tiplication factor is changed by varying the concentration of a neutron absorber (usually boric acid) dissolved in the coolant water. Fuels capable of higher bumup have gadolinium included to offset the higher enrichment of the fuel during the early stages of core life. Where the size of the reactor is an important consideration, as it is in a sub­marine, highly enriched fuel is used. This fuel, enriched to over 90 W /0 in 235U and often called fully enriched, makes it possible to reduce the overall dimensions of the core and pressure vessel. The highly enriched uranium is expensive, however, and it cannot be used economically in stationary power plants. The Boiling-Water Reactor For a long time, it was thought that if water were permitted to boil within a reactor, dangerous instabilities would result because of uneven formation and movement of the steam bubbles. Experiments carried out in the early 1950s (the famous BORAX experiments) showed that this was indeed the case if the boiling occurred at low pressure. However, when the pressure was raised, the boiling became stable and the reactor was controllable. Since these first demonstrations of the feasibility of boiling-water reactors, the BWR has reached a high state of development. The BWR and PWR are now competing on a neck-and­neck basis for the commercial nuclear power market in light-water reactors. There are obvious advantages to a BWR. For one thing, the steam is formed in the reactor and goes directly to the turbines-steam generators in separate heat transfer loops are not necessary as they are with the PWR. For this reason, the BWR is said to operate in a direct cycle. Furthermore, it is recalled that, for a given amount of water, more heat can be absorbed as latent heat-that is, the heat necessary to vaporize a liquid-than as sensible heat, which, in the PWR, only changes the temperature of the fluid. Therefore, it follows t� less water must be pumped through a BWR per unit time than through a PWR for the same power output. However, the water becomes radioactive in passing through the reactor core

Since this water is utilized in the electricity-producing side of the plant, all of the components of the steam utilization system-the turbines, condenser, reheaters, pumps, piping, and so on-must be shielded in a BWR plant. The pressure in a BWR is approximately 7 MPa or 900 psi -about one-half the pressure in a PWR. As a result, the wall of the pressure vessel for a BWR need

page number: 163
 text: Sec. 4.5 Power Reactors and Nuclear Steam Supply Systems 145 not be as thick as it is for a PWR. However, it turns out that the power density (watts/cm3) is smaller in a BWR than in a PWR, and so overall dimensions of a pressure vessel for a BWR must be larger than for a PWR of the same power. As far as the cost of the pressure vessel is concerned, these two effects more or less tend to offset one another.

 text: 146 Nuclear Reactors and Nuclear Power Chap. 4 moves upward through the core; as it does, it receives both sensible and latent heat. By the time it reaches the top of the core and enters the upper plenum, a portion of the coolant has been vaporized. This mixture of steam and liquid water next passes through steam separators, which remove most of the water. The steam then goes through a dryer assembly, which removes the remaining water; it then exits from the reactor via a steam line to the turbine. The residual water from the separators and the dryer mixes with feedwater returning from the condenser and passes downward through an annular region external to the core, between the core shroud and the reactor vessel, known as the downcomer, and returns to the lower plenum. The driving force behind the flow of the coolant through the core is provided by a recirculation system. This system consists of two loops external to the reactor vessel, each containing a recirculation pump. These pumps withdraw water near the bottom of the downcomer and pump it at a higher pressure through a pipe manifold to a number of jet pumps (18-24 depending on the reactor power) located within the downcomer, as indicated in Fig. 4.11. A schematic drawing of a jet pump is shown in Fig. 4.12. It is observed that these devices have no moving parts. The recirculating water emerges from the nozzle of the jet pumps at high speed and entrains some of the water in the downcomer, as indicated by the suction flow in Fig. 4.12. Water from the nozzles and entrained water finally emerge from the bottom of the jet pumps into the lower plenum.

The overall efficiency of a BWR plant is on the order of 33% to 34%. The fuel for a BWR is essentially the same as for a PWR, that is, slightly en­riched U02 pellets in sealed tubes-and the core configurations of the two types of reactors are more or less identical. However, BWR control rods are always placed at the bottom of the reactor rather than at the top, as in the case of the PWR. The reason for this is that much of the upper portion of the core of a BWR is normally occupied by steam voids, and movement of the rods in this region does not have as large an effect on the value of k as rod motions in the lower, water-filled part of the core. The rods are thus placed near the part of the reactor where they will do the most good. The Evolutionary and Advanced Light-Water Reactor s In recent years, economic considerations and concerns over the need for higher levels of safety have prompted an effort to develop new advanced reactor concepts. Both boiling and pressurized water reactor designs of this type were developed. These designs feature the use of simplified primary systems and, in the more advanced designs, passive emergency core-cooling systems. The Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR) by GE and System 80+ PWR by ABB/Combustion Engineering represent considerable system simplification, whereas the Advanced Passive 600 (AP600) MWe PWR by Westinghouse and the Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (SBWR) by General Electric represent designs with advanced passive cooling fea­tures as well. Construction costs of nuclear power plants as well as other types of central power stations skyrocketted during the late 1970s and early 1980s. The increase in costs was due in part to the general inflationary trends experienced during this time. A major cause of the cost increase for nuclear power plants was the need to backfit modifications needed as a result of the accident at the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station, TMI, discussed in Section 11.7. In an effort to make the use of nuclear energy economically more competitive, the nuclear industry explored ways to both simplify and increase the safety of the nuclear systems. The conclusions from studies made by both the industry and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) were the need to decrease the number of components and piping and provide more sources of cooling water to the systems for use during an accident. Initial designs such as the ABWR and Systems 80+ are based on simplified system designs to reduce costs along with some safety system enhancements. The AP600 and SBWR include both simplifications and the addition of passive cooling systems for use during a reactor accident. Passive systems use natural processes driven by gravity and temperature differences. Because these systems do not re­quire electrical power they are thought to be nearly fail-safe and much more reli­able. Each of these are discussed in the following sections and comparisons made to conventional reactor designs.

 text: 148 Nuclear Reactors and Nuclear Power Chap. 4 System 80+. The evolutionary ABB CE System 80+ is an advanced design evolutionary PWR. It is evolutionary in that incremental changes were made in key system components that do not represent radical departures from current designs. The significant features of the System 80+ include the use of a large spherical double-wall concrete and steel containment, a larger water inventory in the primary system, a simplified primary system, part-strength control rods that reduce the need to change levels of boron in the coolant, and a safety depressurization system for reducing system pressure during a small break loss of coolant accident (SBLOCA). The primary system features two large steam generators and four coolant pumps (Fig. 4.13). The pressurizer size is increased by 33% and the steam gener­ ator secondary water volume by 25%. Both of these increases enhance the plant's ability to experience transients without large pressure changes. The increased water volume also provides additional time for operator action in the event of an accident. Use of a large 61 m (200 ft) diameter spherical steel containment building provides additional volume for steam expansion during a LOCA as well as provid­ ing a heat sink. The in-reactor containment ref ueling water storage tank provides a sump for collection of coolant during an accident. Advanced Boiling-W ater Reactor .

Figure 4.14 is a cutaway of the ABWR. The most evident difference is the lack of recirculation pumps. Using centrifugal pumps internal to the reactor vessel, GE's ABWR mini­ mizes the risk of a LOCA by eliminating the complex of recirculation piping and pumps found in conventional BWRs. The ABWR also uses fine-motion control rods to enable better fuel manage­ ment and control during operation . Conventional steam separation equipment is used to provide dry steam to the turbines as in current BWRs. Figure 4.14 Cutaway drawing of the ABWR. (Courtesy of General Electric.)

The Westinghouse AP 600 relies heavily on the use of pas­sive safety systems to decrease the probability of core damage. A unique feature of the design is the way the containment is used to provide an ultimate heat sink for the decay heat in the event of a LOCA. Figure 4.15 shows the passive containment cooling used to transfer the decay heat from the reactor via the break in the primary system to the containment and then to the atmosphere. As the steam exits the primary system, it is condensed on the walls of the containment. Natural circulation of air against the outside of the steel-lined con­tainment is encouraged through the unique chimney design of the containment and the presence of a water film on the outside of the steel shell. The primary system in Fig. 4.16 has several features to reduce the probability of a LOCA and subsequent core damage. The primary coolant pumps are canned rotor pumps located in the steam generator plena. The use of canned rotor pumps eliminates the mechanical seals found on existing reactor circulation pumps. The

(Courtesy of Westinghouse Elec­ tric.) 151 pressurizer is also larger by about 30% to reduce the likelihood of opening a safety relief valve during a transient. Core power density is lowered to reduce the proba­bility of core damage. Passive core cooling is provided during a LOCA by two different means. Two large high-pressure core makeup tank provide water during the early stages of an accident. The design uses an automatic depressurization system to reduce pressure so coolant can flow from an external pool to the reactor under gravity. The use of these two passive systems provides for a high-reliability emergency core-cooling capability.

page number: 170
 text: 152 Nuclear Reactors and Nuclear Power Chap. 4 In addition to the passive containment cooling systems and the use of gravity­fed core-cooling systems, the design also has a passive residual heat removal sys­tem that is designed to remove decay heat when the steam generators are not available. Located in a large pool of water called the in-containment refueling water storage tank (lRWST), the heat exchangers provide cooling under normal operating pressure. The IRWST acts as a large source of water during a LOCA and also as a reservoir for the condensation from the containment. Effort has also been made to reduce the number of components and amount of piping as well. For example, compared to a similar 2 loop plant, the AP600 has 75% less piping in the NSSS and 31 % less in the steam systems. There are similar reductions in valves and other components as well. Simplified Boiling-W ater Reactor. The most significant difference be­tween the SBWR developed by General Electric and a conventional design BWR is the use of natural circulation rather than forced circulation of the reactor coolant. The use of natural circulation reduces the power needed to operate the plant. It also reduces the risk of a LOCA by eliminating the complex piping found in the re­circulation system of a conventional BWR. These features both reduce cost and increase safety. Figure 4.17 shows the SBWR in cutaway. An obvious difference in this design is the lack of pumps in either the downcomer or external to the reactor. In addition to the use of natural circulation, the core and vessel are designed to provide additional coolant inventory. In an accident, the additional coolant is expected to prevent core uncovery, significantly reducing the probability of core damage. Finally, there are several completely passive systems that are designed to replace the conventionally engineered safeguards systems. These systems rely on gravity head to drive water into the core under LOCA conditions and to collect coolant by condensing the steam escaping to the containment from the break in the system. The gravity-driven cooling system (GDCS) is designed to collect the coolant and return it to the vessel. It uses coolant condensed by the passive con­tainment cooling system (PCCS) heat exchangers or heat exchangers located in the PCCS pool above the reactor. Vaporized coolant from the break in the reactor sys­tem is condensed in the PCCS and flows to the GDCS tank. There the coolant is injected into the core by gravity. A key feature of the passive system is the ability to rapidly depressurize the reactor once a serious leak is detected. The process involves the use of the au­tomatic depressurization system (ADS), which is used on conventional reactors today. The ADS opens on decreasing system pressure venting steam from the re­actor into the suppression pool. There the steam is condensed. Once the system is depressurized, flow from the GDCS can occur. Figure 4.18 shows a simulation of the SBWR during a LOCA. Notice that the water level never reaches the top of active fuel (TAF).

These designs include the RBMK and VVER reactors. Both have found wide application in the former Soviet Union, former Eastern Bl ock countries, and elsewhere. They have several unique features not found in Western reactor designs. RBMK Reactor The RBMK or channelized large power reactor is a boiling-water reactor. Unlike Western designed BWRs, it does not have a pressure vessel. Instead, the fuel assemblies are located in separate channelized pressure tubes similar to Canadian CANDU reactors. Each fuel assembly is located in its own pressure tube, which allows the reactor to be refueled online. Unlike Western

The primary system (Fig. 4.19), consists of the pressure tubes (usually 1,000 or more), steam and water pipes, steam drums, main circulation pumps, graphite stack, and fuel channels. The main coolant circulation system (MCC) typically consists of two loops. Each loop has two steam water separator drums that provide separation of the steam water mixture. Feedwater enters the steam drums via the feed header and then travels to the suction header via the downcomers. There, three of the four circulation pumps force the coolant into the distribution header and then into the fuel channels where it boils, producing low-quality steam. The fuel channels are independent of one another and may be isolated from the system, allowing the fuel elements to be removed and replaced. The fuel is low-enrichment (2 wlo) UO�. Each fuel rod is made up of 1.15 cm by 1.3 cm fuel pellets inside a zirconiun-niobium tube approximately 3.64 m in length. There are 18 fuel rods in each fuel element and they are arranged in a circular pattern approximately 7.9 cm in diameter. A fuel assembly (Fig. 4.20) consists of two fuel elements stacked end to end forming an assembly 7 m long.

The graphite stack consists of columns of graphite blocks of various sizes and shapes. There are other channels in the graphite for control rods, cooling flow, and instrumentation. The graphite stack is placed inside a hermetically sealed cavity filled with helium and nitrogen. The mixture improves heat transfer from the graphite to the fuel channel and prevents oxidation of the graphite. The entire assembly is then placed within the biological shield. Typically, the reactor is operated inside of a building meeting standard industrial design specifications and not those typical of a Western designed containment building. Typical operating conditions for a 1,500 MWe reactor are given in Table 4.1. Because of the unique capability to refuel online, the RBMK have relatively high availability. They can also be used to produce plutonium, and hence were limited to the fonner Soviet Union. As of this writing, there are 16 RBMK reactors

Two different power ratings were designed and built-l ,000 MWe and 1,500 MWe-by the design agent, the USSR's Ministry of Nuclear Power Industry. VVER Reactors Several versions of the VVER series reactor are in use in the fonner Soviet Union, former Eastern Block, and elsewhere. The basic design of this series of reactors resembles a Western designed PWR. However, these reactors have a number of features that differ significantly from those in use in the United States and other Western countries. Put into operation in the 1970s, the VVER 440 series reactors are all rated at 440 MWe. All of these design reactors have six loops, isolation valves on each loop and a uniquely designed horizontal tubed steam generator. The NSSS drives two 220 MWe steam turbines. Typical operating conditions for the VVER 440 series is given in Table 4.2. Design of the reactor core is significantly different from most Western de­signs since it uses hexagonal fuel assemblies. Each fuel assembly is surrounded by a shroud similar to that found in the U.S. BWRs. The core consists of 312 fuel assemblies and 37 movable control assemblies. The control assemblies have fuel followers that enter the core as the upper portion containing the boron steel control material exits the core. Each assembly consists of 126 fuel rods, each arranged in a triangular pitch. The fuel rod is 9.1 mm in diameter and contains 7.5-mm diam­eter U02 fuel pellets enriched to 2.4-3.6 w / o. The fuel rods are 3.53 m in length. Additional control is accomplished through the use of boric acid as in Western PWRs. Two series of 440s are in operation-the older VVER 230 and the newer VVER 213. These two differ significantly in the design of the containment and the engineered safety systems. The VVER 230s rely on a unique compartmentalization design to contain fission products in the event of fuel failure. Unlike the later 213s, the 230 series has only limited emergency core-cooling capability. The more recent model VVER 213s have a more advanced emergency core-cooling system and a TABLE 4.2 VVER 440 PARAMETERS Power Core height Core diameter Fuel enrichment Coolant temperature Inlet Oulet Steam pressure Coolant system pressure MWt m m % °C °C MPa MPa

Figure 4.21 shows the layout of the reactor cooling system and containment for a VVER 213. The larger VVER 1 OOO-series reactor is a four-loop PWR closely resembling a standard Western PWR. Rated at 1,000 MWe, these reactors came into service in the mid-1980s. They differ from the 440 design series in that they use a con­ tainment similar to Western PWRs and have four loops with a steam generator in each loop. Like the VVER 440 reactors, the VVER 1000s use horizontal steam generators and two turbines. Figure 4.22 shows the layout of a typical VVER 1000. Like the VVER 440, the VVER 1000 uses hexagonal fuel elements . The 1000-series fuel assemblies are, however, much larger than those of the VVER 440 design and do not have fuel assembly shrouds.

The control rod designs are nearly identical to those of West­ern reactors and consist of identical control pins connected at the top into a spider web unit. The unit can be inserted into corresponding water channels in the fuel assembly. Gas Cooled Thermal Reactor Natural uranium, graphite-moderated re­actors were developed in the United States during World War II for the conver­sion of 238U to 239pu for military purposes. Following the war, this type of reactor formed the basis for the nuclear weapons programs of the United States and several other nations. It is not surprising, therefore, that natural uranium-fueled reactors be­came the starting point for the nuclear power industry, especially in nations such as Great Britain and France, which at the time lacked the facilities for producing the enriched uranium necessary to fuel reactors of the light-water type. Both of these countries have now constructed diffusion plants, however, and recent versions of both British and French reactors use enriched fuel. The original plutonium-producing reactors in the United States had a once­through, open-cycle, water coolant system, while the British-production reactors utilized a once-through air-cooling system. However, for the British and French power reactors, a closed-cycle gas-cooling system was adopted early on. This pro­vides containment and control over radioactive nuclides produced in or absorbed by the coolant. In these reactors, the coolant gas is CO2. This gas is not a strong absorber of thermal neutrons and it does not become excessively radioactive. At the same time, CO2 is chemically stable below 540°C and does not react with either the moderator or fuel. A drawing of the Hinkley Point B advanced gas reactor (AGR) in western England is shown in Fig. 4.23. The reactor core is a 16-sided stack of intercon­nected graphite bricks, which contains vertical fuel channels arranged in a square lattice. The fuel consists of slightly enriched (1.4%-2.6% in different zones) U02 pellets in stainless steel tubes, which in turn are located within a graphite sleeve to form a single fuel element. These fuel elements are arranged in the fuel channels in such a way that the CO2 can pass smoothly between the fuel and moderator. The actual flow of gas in the reactor is somewhat complicated, but the details are unimportant for the present discussion. In effect, however, the CO2 flows up through the channels in the core into a plenum and then through one or the other of several steam generators surrounding the core. From the steam generators, the CO2 goes through gas circulators (blowers) that provide the pumping power for the gas, and the cycleis complete. As indicated in Fig. 4.23, the core, steam generators, and circulators are all located within a large, prestressed concrete reactor vessel. One of the great advantages of gas-cooled reactors is their high thermal ef­ficiency. The plant described previously produces superheated steam at approxi­mately 540°C and 16 MPa; it operates at an overall efficiency of about 40%, as

Nevertheless, the British AGR evidently does not produce electricity as cheaply as a PWR, and in 1979, the British government announced that in the future its nuclear program would be based on the construction of PWRs. In the United States, gas-coole d reactor technology has been centered at the General Atomic Company, where the high-temperature gas-coole d reactor (HTGR) was developed. This is a graphite-moderated, helium-cooled. thermal reactor. As a coolant, helium is excellent. It is far more inert than CO2, does not absorb neu­ trons, and therefore does not become radioacti ve. However, the helium picks up small amounts of radioactive gases that escape from the fuel along with radioac­ tive particles from the walls of the cooling channels, so as a practical matter the coolant in the HTGR is somewhat radioactive.

page number: 180
 text: 162 Nuclear Reactors and Nuclear Power Chap. 4 At startup, the HTGR is fueled with a mixture of thorium and highly en­riched uranium, but in time the 233U, converted from the thorium, replaces some of the 235U. The reactor does not breed, however, so that some 235U must always be present. The equilibrium core contains 235U, fertile 232Th, and all the recycled 233U. Because it uses high-enrichment fuel, the HTGR is considerably smaller than comparable British gas-cooled reactors fueled with natural or slightly enriched ura­nium. As a result, the capital cost of the HTGR is much less than that of the British reactor. Fuel for the HTGR is in the form of small particles of uranium and thorium dicarbides (U, Th) C2, which are specially coated to prevent the release of fission products. These particles are cast into rods about 5 cm long and 1.3 cm in diameter using a carbonaceous binder. The rods are then inserted into holes in hexagonal graphite blocks about 80 cm high and 35 cm across, and the blocks are arranged in a cylindrical array to form the core. Additional holes through the graphite provide passages for the coolant gas while others hold channels for control rods. The operation of the HTGR is similar to the British AGR described earlier.

As in the British reactors, all of these components are located within a prestressed concrete reactor vessel. Steam is obtained from the HTGR at approximately 540°C and 16 MPa, which gives an overall plant efficiency of about 40%. The most recent U.S. reactor of this type was the Ft. St. Vrain reactor. This unit was a 330 MWe HTGR and operated until its shutdown in 1989. A unique feature of the HTGR is the very high temperature of the circulat­ ing helium-between 815°C and 870°C Such helium can be used directly in a gas turbine to drive an electrical generator, thus eliminating the need for an inter­ mediate steam cycle. There are many advantages to such a system. For one thing, gas turbines and their associated cycle components are considerably more com­ pact than comparable steam cycle equipment . Furthermore, the temperature of the reject (second-law) heat is so high that this energy can be used in a number of practical applications, leading to an overall efficiency of the HTGR system as high as 50%. Besides producing electricity, the HTGR can provide high-temperature heat required in many chemical processes, such as the gasification of coal and de­ salination of sea water, among others. The Heavy-Water Reactor The heavy-water moderated and cooled re­ actor (HWR) has been under development in several countries, especially Canada. The interest in heavy-water reactors in Canada dates back to World War II, when the country was deeply involved in HWR research for military purposes. After the war, the Canadian s immediately recognized the unique advantages of heavy-water reactors. Since an HWR can be fueled with natural uranium, the large resources of uranium known to exist in Canada could be used directly, thus making it unnec­ essary for that country to construct costly uranium enrichment plants or to depend on the United States or any other nation for enriched fuel. The Canadians also rec­ ognized that the gas-cooled, graphite-mo derated reactors of the type being built in Great Britain had to be quite large if fueled with natural uranium; in the Canadian economy, constructing such a plant would have proved too expensive. The Cana·· dian heavy-water reactor, known as CANOU, the acronym for CANada Deuteri um Uranium, has been successful in Canada and has been exported abroad. A heavy-wa ter reactor can operate on natural uranium because the absorption cross-section of deuterium (0 = 2H) for thermal neutrons is very small-much smaller, for example, than the cross-section of ordinary hydrogen (H = 1 H). How­ ever, since the deuterium in 020 is twice as heavy as the hydrogen in H20, 020 is not as effective in moderating neutrons as H20. Neutrons, on the average, lose less energy per collision in 020 than they do in H20, and they require more collisions and travel greater distances before reaching thermal energies than in H20. The core of an HWR is therefore considerably larger than that of an LWR, and if an HWR is built like an LWR, with the fuel immersed in a 020-filled pressure vessel, the vessel must be very large.

page number: 182
 text: 164 Nuclear Reactors and Nuclear Power Chap. 4 To avoid the use of a large pressure vessel, the CANDU utilizes the pressure tube concept. In this design, the reactor consists of a large horizontal cylindrical tank, called the calandria, which contains the D20 moderator under essentially no pressure. This tank is penetrated by several hundred horizontal tubes or channels, which contain the fuel. The D20 coolant flows through these tubes at a pressure of about 10 MPa and does not boil. Thus by pressurizing the coolant rather than the whole reactor, a large pressure vessel is not required. A simplified flow diagram for the coolant in a CANDU reactor is shown in Fig. 4.25. As indicated, a complete coolant circuit involves two fuel tubes and two circulation loops. The D20 enters the reactor at a temperature of about 266°C and exits at 310°C. It passes from the reactor to a header-that is, a junction chamber for the coolant tubes-and then to an inverted U-tube steam generator where steam is produced and carried to the turbines. The coolant then returns to the reactor, passing in the opposite direction through an adjacent fuel tube, where it is heated again before flowing to a second steam generator. The pressurizer shown in the figure performs the same function in the CANDU system as it does in the PWR. Although most of the heat from the fuel is carried away by the D20 coolant, some energy is deposited in the D20 moderator. This energy is removed by the moderator coolant loop shown at the bottom of the figure. Unfortunately, the pressurized D20 coolant in a CANDU reactor cannot be raised to a temperature high enough to produce steam at a pressure and temperatur e comparable to that produced in light-water reactors. Therefore, the thermodynamic efficiency of CANDU plants is only between 28% and 30%, and CANDU power stations must use larger turbines with specially designed blades to prevent erosion by wet steam. To circumvent these problems, the Canadians have experiment ed with other coolants (but the same moderator)-in particular, boiling light water or an organic fluid. The organic coolant is capable of providing an especially high­ outlet temperature from the reactor. However, both light water and organic fluids increase the total amount of neutron absorption in the reactor. Thus, neither of these coolants provide sufficient advantage over the D20 coolant to be adopted in CANDUs, as long as these are fueled with natural uranium. CANDU fuel is arranged in what Canadians call bundles, one of which is shown in Fig. 4.26. It is 49.5 cm long and 10.2 cm in diameter, and consists of 37 hollow Zircaloy tubes filled with natural uranium U02 pellets. The fuel tubes are welded to end plates and kept apart by spacers. This fuel is capable of delivering a burnup of about 7.5 MW d/kg. A unique feature of CANDU reactors is that they are refueled online-that is, while the reactor is in operation. As shown in Fig. 4.27, this is accomplished by two fueling machines operated together at opposite ends of a single fuel tube. A fresh fuel bundle is introduced into one of the machines, which then pushes the bundle into the end of the fuel tube. This simultaneously pushes a bundle out at the far end

The latter bundle is then transferred to an onsite underwater spent fuel repository. Online refueling contributes to very high availability of CANDU plants (about 90%), since, unlike LWR plants, they need not be shut down to refuel. The overall size and hence the D20 inventory of a CANDU reactor can be substantially reduced by using slightly enriched rather than natural uranium. This

 text: 168 Nuclear Reactors and Nuclear Power Chap. 4 has the further advantage of reducing the annual fuel requirements for the reactor and thus tends to conserve uranium resources. An enrichment in the neighborhood of 1.2 W /0 appears to be optimum for this purpose. CANDU is not the only type of HWR in the world. The German firm Kraftwerk Union (now part of the Siemens Group) has designed a natural uranium­ fueled HWR that uses a large pressure vessel instead of pressure tubes. Two reac­ tors of this type are located in Atucha, Argentina, near Buenos Aires. Japan has also developed an HWR called Fugen. This reactor, like the CANDU, consists of a tank of D20 at relatively low pressure that is penetrated by a large number of pressure tubes. Unlike CANDU, however, the pressure tubes contain ordinary wa­ ter that boils within the reactor core. The reactor is fueled with a mixture of oxides of natural uranium and plutonium (obtained by conversion in LWRs) instead of natural uranium alone. Fugen is therefore considerably smaller than CANDU. Breeder Reactors It is shown in Section 4.6 that the world's reserves of 235U are not adequate to indefinitely support the needs of a nuclear power industry based only on burner or converter reactors. With the introduction of breeder reactors, however, the fuel base switches from 235U to 238U or thorium, both of which are considerably more plentiful than 235U. Furthermore, all of the depleted uranium-that is, the residual uranium, mostly 238U, remaining after the isotope enrichment process-can be uti­ lized as breeder fuel. Breeders are capable of satisfying the electrical energy needs of the world for thousands of years. There is a considerable difference of opinion in the United States and else­ where regarding the desirability or urgency of the need to develop breeders, owing to a divergence of views on the adequacy of uranium resources and the potential for nuclear proliferation. Some authorities feel that sufficient amounts of uranium will be discovered and produced, albeit at increasing cost, to satisfy the requirements of the domestic and export markets well into the first half of the next century. Other experts are less optimistic about uranium supplies and see the development of the breeder as insurance against future shortages of uranium. Yet still others express deep concern over the possible diversion of plutonium to weapons use resulting in the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Abroad, the need for the breeder is less in doubt. The major industrial nations-Great Britain, France, Germany, and Japan-have essentially no in­ digenous l)ranium resources, and these countries must utilize to the fullest extent possible all of the uranium they import. In addition, these nations possess or can lay claim to large quantities of depleted uranium. France, for instance, has enough depleted uranium on hand to satisfy its electrical needs for the next 100 years if the uranium is used for fuel in breeder reactor power plants. France and Japan have

Four types of breeder reactors have been developed to date: the liquid­ metal cooled fast breeder reactor (LMFBR), the gas-cooled fast breeder reactor (GCFR), the molten salt breeder reactor (MSBR), and the light-water breeder reactor (LWBR). Each of these is considered in turn. The LMFBR The fundamental principles underlying the fast breeder reac­ tor concept were discovered before the end of World War II, and the potential im­ pact of breeder reactors on future energy supplies was immedia tely recognized. The first experimental breeder reactor was a small plutonium-fueled, mercury-cooled device, operating at a power level of 25 kW, that first went critical in 1946 in Los Alamos, New Me xico. A 1.3 MW breeder, cooled with a mixture of sodium and potassium, was placed in operation in 1951 at the Argonne National Labora­ tory in Idaho. This reactor, the Experimental Breeder Reactor-I (EBR-I), produced steam in a secondary loop that drove a turbine generator. The system produced 200 kW of electricity, the world's first nuclear-generated electricit y-and it came from an LMFBR! Since these early experiments, dozens of LMFBRs have been con­ structed around the world. As of this writing, the LMFBR is the only breeder that has reached a stage of significa nt commercialization anywhere in the world. The LMFBR operates on the uranium-plutonium fuel cycle (for further dis­ cussion of reactor fuel cycles, see Section 4.6). This means that the reactor is fueled with bred isotopes of plutonium in the core or driver, and the blanket is natural or depleted uranium. It is recalled from Fig. 4.2 that 1}, the number of fission neutrons emitted per neutron absorbed by 239pu, increases monoton ically with increasing neutron energy for energies above 100 ke V. It follows that the breeder ratio and breeding gain increase with the average energy of the neutrons inducing fission in the system. Therefore, insofar as possible, every effort must be made to prevent the fission neutrons in a fast reactor from slowing down. This means, in particular, that lightweight nuclei must largely be excluded from the core. There is no moderator, of course, so the core and blanket contain only fuel rods and coolant. Sodium has been universally chosen as the coolant for the modern LMFBR. With an atomic weight of 23, sodium does not appreciably slow down neutrons by elastic scattering, although, as noted earlier, it does moderate neutrons to some extent by inelastic scattering. Sodium is also an excellent heat transfer agent, so that an LMFBR can be operated at high power density. This, in turn, means that the LMFBR core can be comparatively small. Furthermore, because sodium has such a high boiling point (882°C at 1 atm), reactor coolant loops can be operated at high temperature and at essentially atmospheric pressure without boiling, and no heavy pressure vessel is required. The high coolant temperature also leads to high-temperature, high-pressure steam, and high plant efficiency. Finally, sodium,

page number: 188
 text: 170 Nuclear Reactors and Nuclear Power Chap. 4 unlike water, is not corrosive to many structural materials. Reactor compone nts immersed in liquid sodium for years appear like new after the excess sodium ha" been washed off. Sodium also has some undesirable characteristics. Its melting point, 98()C is much higher than room temperature, so the entire coolant system must be kept heated at all times to prevent the sodium from solidifying. This is accomplished by winding a spiral of insulated heating wire called tracing along coolant piping, valves, and so forth. Sodium is also highly reactive chemically. Hot sodium reacts violently with water and catches fire when it comes in contact with air, emitting dense clouds of white sodium peroxide smoke. This latter behavior is actually an advantage for sodium cooling since it represents a kind of built-in leak detector. Thus any sodium oozing from an incipient crack in a cooling pipe4 or from the packing of a valve can immediately be identified by the presence of white smoke. For this reason, moreover, LMFBRs are inherently very tight systems and emit far less radiation to the environment than comparable LWRs. Operation of these reactors has yet to show that they can be operated with high availability on a large commercial scale, however. The operational problems center on the use of Na and how to properly design the reactor internals, valves, and pumps to reliably operate the system. Unfortunately, sodium absorbs neutrons, even fast neutrons, leading to the formation of the beta-gamma emitter 24Na, with a half-life of 15 hours. Therefore, sodium that passes through the reactor core becomes radioactive. LMFBR plants operate on the steam cycle-that is, the heat from the reactor is ultimately utilized to produce steam in steam generator s. Because of the radioactivity of the sodium and because sodium reacts so violently with water, it is not considered sound engi­ neering practice to carry the sodium coolant directly from the reactor to the steam generators. Leaks have often occurred in steam generators between the sodium on one side and the water on the other, and such leaks could lead to the release of radioactivity. Therefore, all LMFBRs utilize two sodium loops: the primary reac­ tor loop carrying radioactive sodium, and an intermediate sodium loop containing nonradioactive sodium, which carries the heat from the primary loop via an inter­ mediate heat exchanger (symbolized by IHX) to the steam generator. The detailed manner in which the intermediate sodium loop is arranged divides LMFBRs into two categories: the loop-type LMFBR and the pool-type LMFBR. A schematic diagram of a loop-type LMFB R plant is shown in Fig. 4.28. As indicated in the figure, the core and blanket of the reactor and control rods, not shown) are located in a reactor vessel not unlike that of an LWR, except that the vessel need not withstand high pressure. To catch any sodium that might leak 4Note that, because LMFBRs operate at close to atmospheric pressure, there is no tendency for the sodium coolant to burst out of the system like the water in an LWR. This is one of the distinct safety features of an LMFBR.

In the loop-type system, the IHX and all other components of the heat transfer system are located external to the reactor vessel. A typical 1,000 MWe LMFBR plant has three or four primary loops, each with its own intermedi ate and water-steam loop. Since the sodium in a primary loop is radioactive, all components in a primary loop must be heavily shielded. Furthermore, an atmosphere of nitrogen, with which sodium does not react, is maintained in those portions of a loop-type LMFB R plant containing the primary loops; this reduces the likelihood of fires involving radioac­ tive sodium. For the same reason, empty regions above the sodium within the re­ actor vessel and the primary reactor pumps are made inert with argon. The sodium in the secondary loops is not radioactive and neither is the water or steam, so none of these loops needs to be shielded. The distinguishing feature of a pool-type LMFBR, which is pictured in Fig. 4.29, is that all of the primary loops-including the pumps and the IHXs-are lo­ cated, together with the core and blanket, within the reactor vessel. The sodium is circulated by the pumps through the core and blanket and then through the IHXs. The secondary sodium enters the reactor vessel, picks up heat from the IHXs, and then exits to the steam generator s. To prevent the sodium in the IHXs from becom­ ing radioactive, these components are carefully shielded from the reactor neutrons. The sodium leaving a pool-type LMFBR is therefore not radioactive.

 text: Sec. 4.5 Power Reactors and Nuclear Steam Supply Systems 173 Of the two types of LMFBRs, the loop-type appears based on the simpler con­ cept. Except for the presence of the intermedi ate loop, it is not much different in design from an ordinary PWR. All primary loop components-the reactor, pumps, heat exchangers, and so on-are separate and independent. This makes inspec­ tion, maintenance, and repairs easier than when these components are immersed in hot, radioactive, and opaque sodium, as they are in pool-type systems. However, substantial amounts of shielding are required around all the primary loops in a loop-type plant, which makes these plants resemble large, heavily built fortresses. With a pool-type LMFBR, by contrast, no radioactivity leaves the reactor ves­ sel, so no other component of the plant must be shielded. 5 Furthermore, the usual practice is to locate pool-type reactor vessels at least partially underground, so that only the uppermost portion of the vessel requires heavy shielding. It is possible, therefore, to walk into the reactor room where a pool-type reactor is operating and even walk across the top of the reactor without receiving a significant radiation dose-so tight and compact is this type of LMFBR. The two operating commer­ cial LMFBRs are the French Super Phenix and the Japanese Monju reactor. Super Phenix is a pool type whereas Monju is a loop type LMFBR. The core of an LMFBR consists of an array of fuel assemblies, which are hexagonal stainless steel6 cans between 10 and 15 cm across and 3 or 4 m long that contain the fuel and fertile material in the form of long pins. An assembly for the central region of the reactor contains fuel pins at its center and blanket pins at either end. Assemblies for the outer part of the reactor contain only blanket pins. When these assemblies are placed together, the effect is to create a central cylindrical driver surrounded on all sides by the blanket. The fuel pins are stainless steel tubes 6 or 7 mm in diameter, containing pellets composed of a mixture of oxides of plutonium (PU02) and uranium (U02). The equivalent enri chment of the fuel-that is, the percent of the fuel that is plutonium-ranges between 15 and 35 W /0 depending on the reactor in question. The fuel pins are kept apart by spacers, or in some cases, wire wound helically along each pin. The pins in the blanket, which contain only U02, are larger in diameter, about 1.5 cm, because they require less cooling than the fuel pins. Both fuel and blanket pins are more tightly packed (closer together) in an LMFBR than in an LWR or HWR because the heat transfer properties of sodium are so much better than those of water. The liquid sodium coolant enters through holes near the bottom of each assembly and passes upward around the pins, removing heat as it goes and then exiting at the top of the core. SIn both loop-type and pool-type LMFBRs, shielding must also be provided for sodium dump tanks and spent fuel areas. °Zirconium and its alloys cannot be used in an LMFBR because zirconium reacts chemically with sodium.

 text: 174 Nuclear Reactors and Nuclear Power Chap. 4 Although virtually all present-day LMFB Rs operate with uranium-plutonium oxide fuel, there is considerable interest in the future use of fuel composed of uranium-pluto nium carbide since larger breeding ratios are possible with this kind of fuel. This, in turn, is due to the fact that, although there are two atoms of oxygen per atom of uranium in the oxide (chemical formula U02), there is only one atom of carbon per uranium atom in the carbide (whose formula is UC). Light atoms such as carbon and oxygen tend to moderate fission neutron s. Since there are frac­ tionally (one-half) fewer of the atoms in the carbide than in the oxide, it follows that the energy distribution of neutrons in a carbide-fueled LMFBR is shifted to higher energies than in a comparable oxide-fueled LMFBR. The breeding ratio, therefore, goes up because 17 increases with neutron energy. At the same time, the more energetic neutron spectrum leads to additional fissions in the fertile material. This effect is shown in Table 4.3, where breeding ratios and compound doubling times are given for the different types of fuel. LMFBRs can also operate with thorium- 233U oxide fuel. In this case, the driver portions of the fuel assemblies contain 233U instead of plutonium, and thorium takes the place of natural or depleted uranium. The blanket assemblies are all thorium. However, as indicated in Table 4.3, the substitution of thorium- 233U for uranium- plutonium has a devastating effect on both breeding ratio and doubling time. An LMFBR under these circumstances effectively does not breed. The control rods for LMFBRs are usually stainless steel tubes filled with boron carbide, although other materials have also been used. At one time, it was thought that a fast reactor like the LMFBR would be more difficult to control than most thermal reactors because the fission neutrons do not spend as much time slow­ ing down and diffusing before inducing further fissions. However, years of operat­ ing experience have shown that fast reactors, in fact, are highly stable and easily controlled. Steam from an LMFBR plant is delivered superheated to the turbines at about 500°C and between 16 and 18 MPa. The overall plant efficiency is in the neighbo r­ hood of 40%.

 text: Sec. 4.5 Power Reactors and Nuclear Steam Supply Systems 175 Other Reactor Types The GCFR This reactor concept is a logical extrapolation from HTGR technology. It is a helium-cooled reactor fueled with a mixture of plutonium and uranium. The core of the GCFR is similar to that of an LMFBR, with mixed PU02 and U02 pellets in stainless steel pins, except that the pins are not as close together as they are in the LMFBR. Also, the pins in the GCFR have a roughened outer sur­ face to enhance heat transfer to the passing coolant. Figure 4.30 shows a drawing of a 360 MWe (1090 MWt) GCFR nuclear steam supply system. The helium, at a pressure of 10.5 MPa, enters the core from the bottom at a temperature of 298°C and leaves from the top of the core at 520°C. The heated gas then passes down through three steam generators under the action of electrically driven circulators (blowers ). The GCFR, unlike the LMFBR, requires no intermediate heat exchang­ ers. The reactor is provided with auxiliary circulators and heat exchangers for use in case of a failure of the main cooling loops.

 text: 176 Nuclear Reactors and Nuclear Power Chap. 4 main circulator motors are located within a prestressed concrete reactor vessel as shown in the figure. The steam generators produce superheated steam at 485°C and 10.5 MPa. In principle, the entire steam cycle can be circumvented in a GCFR, as it can in an HTGR, and the helium coolant used directly in a gas turbine, with all the advantages this offers. Being a gas, helium is essentially a void in the reactor and it has almost no effect on the neutrons in the reactor. The neutron spectrum is therefore harder (more energetic) than in the LMFBR, where moderation occurs as the result of inelastic collisions with the sodium. It follows that the breeding ratio is higher for the GCFR than for the LMFBR since the average value of 1] is higher and the doubling time is correspondingly shorter. One additional advantage of helium cooling should be mentioned. The eco­ nomics of a power reactor are determined by many factors, including the availabil­ ity of the plant-the fraction of time during which the plant can, in fact, be oper­ ated. It is important that the time required for routine maintenance and corrective repairs be kept as low as possible. Since the coolant in a GCFR does not become overly radioactive, it is possible to work on any part of the coolant loops soon after the reactor is shut down. If a problem develops within the reactor, the source of the trouble can be quickly determined by visual means. Comparable maintenance and repairs are much more difficult with the LMFBR because sodium is both radioac­ tive and opaque, and because it must be heated at all times to prevent solidification. Some authorities believe that the GCFR is potentially capable of providing the low­ est power costs of any reactor conceived to date. The MSBR This is a thermal breeder that operates on the 233U-thorium cycle. It is recalled that 233U is the only fissile isotope capable of breeding in a ther­ mal reactor. The MSBR concept is a unique design among reactors in that the fuel, fertile material, and coolant are mixed together in one homogeneous fluid. This is composed of various fluoride salts that, at an elevated temperature, melt to become a clear, nonviscous fluid. The composition of a typical molten salt mixture is given in Table 4.4. All of the elements in the salt mixture, with the exception of the TABLE 4.4 COMP OSITION IN MOLE PERCE NT OF A MOLTEN SALT REACTOR FUEL Salt Mole percent 7LiF 72 BeF2 16 ThF4 12 2J3UF4 0.3

(Cour­ tesy of Oak Ridge National Laborator y.) 177 thorium and uranium, have very small thermal neutron absorption cross-sections.7 This is a vital consideration in a thermal breeder since the value of 17 is low, and neutrons must be carefully conserved. In addition to their excellent neutronic prop­ erties, the fluoride salts have a high solubility for uranium, they are among the most stable of all chemical compounds, they have very low vapor pressure at high temperature, and they have reasonably good heat transfer properties. Furthermore, these salts are not damaged by radiation, do not react violently with air or water, and are inert to some common structural materials and graphite. Figure 4.31 shows a diagram of the principal components in an MSBR plant. The reactor core consists of an assembly of graphite moderator elements, which are provided with channels for the passage of the molten salt mixture. When this fluid passes through the core, the system becomes critical and the fission energy is absorbed directly in the fluid. The heated fluid then flows through a heat exchanger in an intermediate coolant loop and returns to the reactor, a portion being diverged for chemical processing. Several important operations are performed in the chemical processing part of an MSBR plant. It is remembered from Section 4.2 that the intermediate nuclide 7 At 0.0253 eV, all eLi) = 0.037 b, all (Be) = 0.0092 b, aa (F) = 0.0095 b.

 text: 178 Nuclear Reactors and Nuclear Power Chap. 4 in the conversion from 232Th to 233U is 233Pa, which has a half-life of 27.4 days. Since this is long compared with the circulation time of the fluid in the reactor and since 233Pa has a large absorption cross-section for thermal neutrons (about 41 b). the 233Pa must be removed from the circulating fluid and stored, lest it be trans­ formed by neutron absorption to the valueless isotope 234Pa before it has had an opportunity to decay into 233U. The 233U is eventually separated from the decay­ ing 233Pa, a portion is returned to the reactor fluid, and the excess is sold for fuel in other MSBRs. In a separate chemical processing operation, the fission products produced from the fissioning of the fuel are removed from the diverted fluid. In ordinary, solid-fueled reactors, these fission products accumulate in the fuel ele­ ments and are responsible, in part, for the necessity to make periodic fuel changes in these types of reactors. The ease with which the fuel can be changed and the fact that fission products can be removed, both on a continuous basis, are especially attractive features of the molten salt reactor.8 No time is lost in refueling, and the reactor can operate for long periods between shutdowns. There are several other advantages to the MSBR. First of all, because of the good neutron economy, the fuel inventory of an MSBR is very small-about 1.0 to 1.2 kg of fissile material per MWe of plant output compared with about 3 kg per MWe for an LWR or 3 to 4 kg per MWe for the LMFBR. Furthermore, because of the low vapor pressure of the molten salts, the MSBR operates at just a little above atmospheric pressure and thus no expensive pressure vessel is required. Finally, since high temperatures are possible with the molten salts, the MSBR can produce superheated steam at 24 MPa and 540°C, which leads to a very high overall plant efficiency of about 44%. There are also drawbacks to the MSBR. For one thing, as the fuel flows out of the reactor, it carries the delayed neutron precursors with it; when the neutrons are emitted, they activate the entire fuel-contai ning loop. Maintenance and repairs to any component in the system may therefore require extensive reactor down­ time and extensive automatic, remotely operated equipment. The breeding ratio of the MSBR is in the 1.05 to 1.07 range, much smaller than for the LMFBR or GCFR. Doubling times are expected to be from 13 to 20 years. Finally, the need to handle and process the radioactive mixture limits the commercial application of this technology. The LWBR For many years, it was the accepted view that it is not possible to build an ordinary light-water reactor that will breed even if it is fueled with 8 However, the fact that solid fuel elements are not used in the MSBR may actually hinder its development since reactor manufacturers are naturally reluctant to pursue reactor systems that do not carry with them the promise of long-term fuel-fabrication contracts.

For one thing, it was thought that too many neutrons would be lost at thermal energies owing to the large absorption cross-section of water. It was recognized that this problem could be avoided by reducing the amount of water relative to fuel in the core. In so doing, the energy spectrum of the neutrons would be shifted to higher energies due to the decreased moderation from the water. This shift would. in turn, mean that a larger fraction of the neutrons would be absorbed in the 233lJ at intermedi ate energies (l eV ::s E ::s 10 keY), where the early data showed that rJ fell to a value only slightly greater than 2. The overall result would therefore be the same-namely, that the reactor would not breed. During the early 1960s, however, new experiments showed that rJ is, in fact, sufficiently larger than 2 in the intermediate energy range to make breeding possible, provided losses of neutrons are strictly controlled. Even when a special effort is made in the design of the LWBR to reduce neutron losses, its overall breeding gain will be very small-too small to make the reactor a net producer of 233U for other reactors of this type. However, enough excess 233U (namely, from 1%-2%) would be obtained over the life of a core to compens ate for the loss of 233U accompanying the chemica l reprocessing of the fuel. Thus, once an LWBR is put into operation, it presumably could be fueled indefinitely with 232Th, of which there are abundant resources. To see whether breeding can actually be achieved in a light-water reactor, the U.S. Department of Energy developed an LWBR core that was installed in the government-owned pressurized water reactor at Shippingport, Pennsylvania. The system operated well, producing a breeding ratio between 1.01 and 1.02 as designed. This experiment confirmed the technical feasibility of installing such breeder cores in existing and future pressurized water reactors. Such a conver­ sion from the burning of relatively scarce 235lJ to more plentiful thorium would significantly improve the overall utilization of nuclear fuel in these reactors and could extend indefinitely the light-water reactor component of the nuclear power industry. A cross-section through the LWBR core is given in Fig. 4.32. As indicated in the figure, the core consists of hexagonal modu les arranged in a symmetrical array surrounded by a reflector-blanket region. Each module contains an axially movable seed region-that is, a region having a multiplication factor greater than unity and a stationary, annular hexagonal blanket with k < 1. Each of these regions, in turn, consists of arrays of tightly packed, but not touching, fuel rods contai ning pellets of thorium dioxide (Th02) and 233UC2, the latter in varying amounts from 0 to 6 W /0 in the seed and from 0 to 3 W /0 in the blanket region. A module cross-section showing the fuel rods, which are smaller in the seed than in the blanket, is shown in Fig. 4.33. Control of the reactor is accomplished by the movement of the seed region within each module. This changes the leakage of neutrons from the core and hence

Chap. 4 the value of the mUltiplication factor. As indicated in Fig. 4.34, the leakage is small when the seed is inserted, but increases as the seed is withdrawn. This novel method of control is necessary for the LWBR to conserve neutrons. Ordinary control rods cannot be used because they would absorb too many neutrons to permit breeding. Figure 4.34 also shows the rather complex distribution of Th02 and 233U02 in the fuel modules, which is supposed to provide the reactor with good control and power characteri stics. The fuel distribution shown is obtained by differential loading of the fuel tubes, which extend the full length of each module. Mobile Power Reactors One of the widest 'lPplic'ltions of nuclear power is in its use for propulsion of ships. This idea was fostered by the legendary Admiral Hyman G. Rickover, who also played a key role in development of the commercial nuclear power program. Starting with the Nautilus, the U.S. Navy and later the British, French, and former Soviet Union all adopted nuclear propulsion as the primary power source for sub­ marines. Both the U.S. and former Soviet Union Navies also use nuclear power for the propulsion of surface ships.

(Courtesy of the U.S. Department of Energy.) 181 The requirements of a mobile power reactor differ somewhat from those of a commercial central power station, in that the reactors and associated systems must be compact and long lived. As a result, the designs are different from those of the larger commercial reactors. Initially, two competing concepts were developed­ a PWR and a liquid metal-cooled design. The PWR reactor concept was used in the Nautilus and the liquid metal-cooled reactor in the Seawall The Nautilus went operational in January 1955 and demonstrated its capabilities by sailing underneath the North Pole in August 1958. Because of maintenance and reliability problems, the liquid metal-cooled de­ sign was abandoned in favor of the PWR concept, and the Seawalf reactor was removed and replaced with a reactor similar to that of the Nautilus. Later reactors were designed for the propulsion of surface ships. The success of nuclear power is clear. All submarines are nuclear powered, and eventually all U.S. aircraft carriers will be as well.

Nuclear Power Around the World Chap. 4 As of this writing, nuclear power is employed as a source of power throughout the world. The United States, Europe, and the former Eastern Block countries derive significant amounts of electricity from nuclear power plants. Over 30 countries rely on nuclear energy for a portion of their electrical needs. In 1996, 442 nuclear power plants generated 2,300 billion kilowatt hours of electricity. In some coun­ tries, nearly all of the electricity is generated by nuclear energy. Nearly 42% of the electricity in Europe is generated by nuclear, 17% in eastern Asia, and 21 % in the United States. By country, the percentages are even higher. In France, for example, over 75% of the electricity comes from nuclear energy. In the United States, 105 nuclear power plants contribute 674 billion kilowatt hours of electricity-or 20% of the nation's electricity supply. Figure 4.36 shows the distribution of electricity generated by nuclear energy in the top 19 producer countries. An additional 40 nuclear power plants are under construction and will add 95 million kilowatts of capacity by the year 20 I O. Table 4.6 lists many of the major users of nuclear energy and the types of reactors employed.

(Courtesy of 100 the International Atomic Energy Agency.) The procurement, preparati on, utilization, and ultimate disposition of the fuel for a reactor is called the reactor fuel cycle. Those parts of a fuel cycle that precede the use of the fuel in a reactor are collectively called the front end of the fuel cycle. That portion related to the fuel after it has been withdrawn from a reactor is called the back end of the fuel cycle. Figure 4.37 shows the once-through fuel cycle for a PWR plant. The mass flows indicated in the figure are in kilograms for a nominal 1,000 MWe (l GWe) plant operated for 1 year at a capacity factor ofO.75-that is, the masses correspond to 0.75 GWe-year. The fuel cycle for a BWR plant is entirely similar except that the mass flows are somewhat different. The cycle begins with the mining of uranium ore. This ore contai ns uranium in the form of a number of complex oxides and is reduced to the oxide U30s, which is then converted to uranium hexafluoride, UF6, the form in which uranium is accepted at current isotope enrichment plants. Approximately 0.5% of the uranium is lost in the conversion to UF6. Following enrichment to about 3 W /0 in 23S U,

Finally, the U02 is fabricated into PWR or BWR fuel assemblies and, in time, loaded into the reactor. Fuel fabrication is accompanied by about 1 % loss of uranium. Approximately once every 2 years, the reactors are shut down and a portion of the fuel (one third of the core of a PWR, one quarter of the BWR) is removed and placed in a spent fuel pool adjacent to the reactor containment building. In the once-through cycle, the spent fuel, after much of its radioactivity has died away, is removed from the pool and disposed of as radioactive waste. Because of the limited capacity of reactor spent fuel pools, it is necessary to transfer the spent fuel to special storage facilities. There the fuel is stored in dry storage casks prior to its ultimate disposal. Figure 4.38 is an example of a dry storage facility used for the interim storage of spent fuel. The once-through cycle is quite wasteful of nuclear energy resource s. Both the PWR and BWR have conversion ratios of about 0.6. Since most of the fuel in these reactors is fertile 238U, non-negl igible amounts of the fissile plutonium isotopes 239pU and 241 Pu are produced while the reactors are in operation. Thus, as

 text: 188 Nuclear Reactors and Nuclear Power Figure 4.38 Dry cask storage facility located at the Cal vert Cliffs nuclear power station. (Courtesy of Baltimore Gas and Electric.) Chap. 4 indicated in Fig. 4.37, a LWR in a nominal 1,000 MWe nuclear plant discharges about 180 kg of fissile plutonium plus 220 kg of 235U at each refueling. This fissile material, if consumed in a reactor, would release the energy equivalent to that of about I million tons of coal. For this reason, the once-through cycle is sometimes called a throw-away fuel cycle. The plutonium and uranium in spent fuel can be utilized if it is recycled as shown in Fig. 4.39. In this arrangement, the spent fuel is reprocessed (reprocessing is discussed in Section 4.8); that is, the plutonium and uranium are chemica lly extracted from the fuel. The plutonium, in the form of PU02, is then mixed with U02,9 fabricated into what is called mixed-oxide fuel, and returned to the reactor. The residual, slightly enriched uranium produced in the repro cessing plant is converted to UF6 for reenrichment. It is estimated that the adoption of a uranium-plutonium recycle would reduce the cumulative U:\08 requirements of LWRs by about 40% over the 30-year lifetimes of these reactors. Neverthel ess, as of this writing (2000), it is still not clear whether the additional costs of reprocessing and mixed-oxide fuel fabrication can in fact render uranium-plutonium recycling an economically attractive fuel option. However, economics notwithstanding, it is reasonable for some nations such as Japan to adopt recycling in an effort to reduce their dependence on foreign uranium suppliers and ensure independence. The fuel cycle for a breeder is similar to that of an LWR with recycling be­ cause, of course, reprocessing and refabrication play key roles in any breeder sys­ tem. Figure 4.40 shows the fuel cycle for an LMFBR. Either natural or depleted 9 Natural uranium. depleted uranium. or the slightly enriched uranium from the reprocessing plant can be used in mixed-oxide fuel. The proportions of fissile plutonium, 235U, and 238U in the fuel would amount to between 3 and 3.5 wlo.

This uranium, together with the uranium and plutonium from the reprocessing plant, is fabricated into core and blanket assem­ blies and introduced into the reactor. The spent fuel, after a cooling period in the spent fuel pool, is sent to be reprocessed. Since an LMFBR produces more fissile plutonium than it needs for its own operation, the excess plutonium is sold for use in other LMFBRs. The fuel cycles for breeders operating on thorium and 233U are essentially the same as that in Fig. 4.40, except that the primary fuel is now thorium and the reprocessed product is Th02 and 233U02. The extremely simple fuel cycle of the CANDU reactor is given in Fig. 4.41. In this cycle, there is no enrichment necessary since the reactor is fueled with natural uranium. The Canadians also do not reprocess their spent fuel in view of the abundant uranium resources in Canada. Should enriched uranium ever be used in CANDU-like reactors, UF6 conversion and enrichment steps would have to be introduced into the cycle. Nuclear Resou rce Utilization In comparing the merits of different types of reactors and their associa ted fuel cy­ cles, an important consideration is the efficiency with which each is capable of utilizing natural uranium or thorium resource s. Thus, in general, different reactor systems require different quantities of uranium ore (or U308) or thorium to pro­ duce the same amount of electrical energy. Since most countries lack abundant in­ digenous uranium resources, uranium utilization is often a key factor in a national decision to adopt a particular type of reactor and fuel cycle.

 text: Sec. 4.6 Nuclear Cycles 191 The nuclear resource utilization, U, is defined quantitatively as the ratio of the amount of fuel that fissions in a given nuclear system to the amount of natural uranium or thorium input required to provide those fissions-that is, fuel fissioned U= -----­resource input (4.1S) In short, U is the fraction of the naturally occurring resource that can be utilized in a reactor fuel cycle for the purpose of generating electric power. As a first example, consider the CANDU reactor operating on a once-through cycle. This reactor is fueled directly with natural uranium dioxide, and the maxi­ mum specific burnup of the fuel is about 7,SOO MWd per metric ton of uranium. Let F be the mass of fuel that fissions out of a total uranium fuel load, L. Then U = F / L, which is also equal to the burn up, B, of the fuel. According to Eq. (3.S7), the fissioning of approximately 1 gram of fissile material releases 1 MWd. Thus, it follows that U = 7,SOO glt = 7,SOO g/106 g = 0.007S. Thus, only .7S% of the natural uranium fuel introduced into a CANDU reactor eventually undergoes fission on the once-through cycle. Consider next an LWR, also on a once-through cycle. Since the fuel is now partially enriched, the amount of natural uranium M u required to produce a fuel load L is considerably larger than L due to the nature of the enrichment process. Thus, for 3 w / a-enriched fuel, it is shown in the next section that M u = S .48L. The uranium utilization is then F F U--- -­ -Mu-S.48L· At a nominal maximum specific burnup of 30,000 MW dlt, U = 30,000/S.48 X 106 = O.OOSS, somewhat less than for a CANDU. With an LWR or CANDU or other converter reactors operated with recycling, the calculation of fuel utilization is much more complicated. A simplified diagram depicting the material flow in such a cycle is shown in Fig. 4.42. In this illustration, the Ls represent the masses of fuel, either fissile or fertile, loaded into the reactor per cycle; the Fs and Rs, respectively, the masses of fuel fissioned or having under­ gone radiative capture; the Ds the masses of fuel discharged from the reactor; and the W s the masses of fuel lost in reprocessing and fuel fabrication, taken together.

Finally, Mfiss is the mass of fissile material-not the total amount of fuel-added as makeup per cycle. as The amount of natural uranium Mu required to produce Mfiss can be written (4.16) where the parameter S is determined by the nature of the enrichment process. It is shown in the next section that S is numerically equal to about 200 and is almost independent of the enrichment of the fuel. The uranium utilization is then given by where F F u- -- -­-Mu -sMfiss' F = Ffissions + Ffert ( 4.17) (4.18) is the total mass of fissions in the fissile and fertile material.

This fractiona l loss is presumed to be the same for fissile and fertile materials. r�rom Fig. 4.41, it is easy to demonstrate that the fissile makeup Mfiss is given by (4.22) so that, by incorporating Eq. (4.21), Mfiss = (Lfiss -Dfiss)(1 -y) + y Lfiss, (4.23) where the difference Lfiss -Dfiss is the net decrease in fissile material resulting from the operation of the reactor. Since neutron capture in fertile material produces fissile material, it follows that But from the definition of the convers ion ratio C, so that Next, using the definition of a and f3, this expression becomes and Lfiss -Dfiss = F(1 + a)(l -f3)(1 -C) Mfiss = F(1 + a)(1 -f3)(1 - y)(1 -C) + y Lfiss. Introducing Eq. (4.25) into Eq. (4.17) gives F U = ----------------------------------�[F(l + a)(l -f3)(l -y)(l -C) + y Lfiss] (4.24) (4.25) (4.26) This formula can be simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by L, the total fuel load, and observing that F / L is equal to B, the specific burnup, and

The final expression for U then becomes B U = -------------------------------�[B(1 + a)(1 -jS)(1 -y)(1 -C) + ye] (4.27) It was implicitly assumed in the derivation of Eq. (4.27) that, in supplying the reactor with the necessary fissile material to maintain the cycle, sufficient fertile material would automati cally be included to make up for fertile material lost in fis­ sion, conversion, reprocessing, and fabrication. This is the case for reactors such as LWRs that use low-enriched or natural uranium fuel having relatively low conver­ sion factors. However, for reactors with high values of C -that is, near breeders, provision must be made for separate introduction of fertile material aside from that which accompanies the other fuel. The total makeup is then From Fig. 4.42, the total material balance is and so M=L-D+W =F(1-y)+yL, Mfert = F(1 -y) + y L -Mfiss. The definition of U is now F U=---­Mu + Mfert F S Mfiss + Mfert ' (4.28) (4.29) where the fertile material is treated as additional resource material. Inserting Eqs. (4.25) and (4.28) and again using the definitions for burnup and enrichment gives finally B U = . (4.30) B(1 -y) + y + (s -1)[B(1 + a)(1 -jS)(1 -y)(1 - C) + ye] Figure 4.43 shows a plot of U as a function of conversion ratio for nominal values of B = 0.04 (4% burnup), (1 + a)(1 -jS) :::: 1," y = 0.02 (2% losses) and e = 0.08 (8% average fuel enrichment). More appropriate numbers can be used for each reactor type and for its corresponding fuel enrichment and conversion factor; these are simply compromise values lying between high-and low-efficiency 11 Detailed calculations show that ex and f3 are numerically small and within a few percentages of one another.

It is observed in the figure that the resource utilization is extremely low, although much higher than in the orlce-through cycle even up to high values of C. Thus, even at C = 0.95, U is about b.05, which means that only 5% of uranium or thorium resources are utilized in sudh a high converter with recycling. When the tenn corresponding to Mfiss in Eq. (4.30) is equal to zero, the cycle is self-sustaining on fertile materia1-that is, no outside fissile material must be added to maintain the reactor in operation. In the prior example, this occurs at a conversion ratio of 1.0484. At this pbint, U is given simply by B U= ------BO -y) + y (4.31) and in the previous example it has the value of 0.676. Any increase in C causes the reactor to breed. However, this does not increase the resource utilization because any additional fertile material added to the reactor over and above Mfert computed earlier is merely converted to excess fissile material. It eventually fissions, but not in the reactor in question. Note that breeders do not consume plutonium; they con­ sume uranium. Thus, as shown in Fig. 4.43, U is a constant in the breeding region and is not a function of C. Incidenta 1ly, values of U in the range from 0.60 to 0.70, corresponding to a resource utilization of between 60% and 70%, are typical for true breeders such as the LMFBR. Example 4.5 Suppose a given nation (such as the United States) has sufficient natural uranium to meet its nuclear electric power needs for 30 years using only LWRs on the once­ through cycle. How long would this same uranium last if used to fuel LMFBRs at the same electrical capacity?

page number: 214
 text: 196 Nuclear Reactors and Nuclear Power Chap. 4 Solution. According to the earlier discussion, U = 0.0055 for the once-through LWR and about 0.67 for an LMFB R. Therefore, the resource would last approxi­ mately 30 x 0.67/0.0055 = 3,655 years. [Ans.] However, note that the 30-year re­ source supply is based on conventional sources of uranium. With the breeder, costly, nonconventional uranium resources can be utilized since uranium costs are irrelevant to breeder power costs. Resource Limitations Table 4.7 summarizes the uranium resource requirements for various nuclear plants and fuel cycles over a 30-year operating period-the assumed lifetime of the plants. In each case, the plant is assumed to produce 1,000 MWe at a capacity factor of 70%. The tails assay (see Section 4.7) was taken as 0.2 w / o. The table demon­ strates again the savings in natural uranium resources resulting from recycle and the enormously reduced need for uranium with breeder reactors. 12 The total, world-wide requirements for uranium over the years depend on the growth of installed nuclear capacity and the mix of reactor types and fuel cycles that is adopted with the passage of time. It is impossible, of course, to accurately predict future nuclear electric capacity because so many uncertain factors enter into decisions to construct new nuclear plants-the growth in the world population, TABLE 4.7 LIFETIME NATURAL URANIUM REQUIREMEN TS FOR DIFFEREN T TYPES OF NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS AND FUEL CYCLE OPTIONS* Plant (Reactor) Types and Cycle LWR Once-through U-Pu recycling HWR Natural uranium, once-through Natural uranium, Pu recycling Low-enriched uranium LMFBR U-Pu recycling Natural Uranium Requirements (t) 4,260 2,665 3,655 1,820 2,505 *From International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation, Summary Volume, International Atomic Energy Agency, 1980. tNatural or depleted uranium. 12Values of all fuel cycle parameters, those in Table 4.7, and in Figs. 4.37 and 4.39 through 4.41, are sensitive to the assumptions used in their derivation.

Predictions of installed nuclear capacity made today can appear ludicrous only a few years later. Since precise prognostication of nuclear capacity cannot be made, it has be­ come a common practice to give projections in terms of high-and low-capacity projections. Future capacity then lies somewhere in between, although there is by no means any guarantee that this will be so. Table 4.8 gives such projections for the United States and the world as prepared by the U.S. Department of Energy and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). These predictions do not provide the breakdown by reactor type or fuel cycle; that will be determined over the long term by decisions that have not as yet been made. However, some things are evident now. For instance, because of the long lead time required to build a nuclear plant in the United States, especially a new type of plant, and because breeder develop­ ment has been terminated by the government, it is reasonably safe to presume that none of the U.S. nuclear capacity will originate in breeder plants until well into this century. For other countries, such as Japan, who have active breeder programs, this may not be the case. Whether sufficient uranium will be available to fuel expanding world nuclear capacity is an issue of continuing controversy even among experts. Uranium is not an especially rare element. It is present in the earth's crust at a concentration by weight of about four parts per million, which makes uranium more abundant than such common substances as silver, mercury, and iodine. There are an estimated 1014 tons of uranium located at a depth of less than 12 or 13 miles, but most of this is at such low concentrations it will probably never be recovered. Most of the uranium used in nuclear plants over the period up to the year 2025 will undoubtedly come from deposits that are now or could be exploited at

Estimates of these so-called conventional re sources are shown in Table 4.9 under two categories: reasonably assured resources (RAR) ·and estimated addi­ tional resources-category I (EAR-I), which reflect different levels of confidence in their actual existence. It should be noted that almost 80% of the total RAR occur in North America, Africa, and Australia. Resources recoverable at a cost of less than $40 per kg of U, denoted as known resources, amount to 886,000 tons. In addition to the RAR and EAR-I categories, the more nebulous categories of estimated additional resources-category II (EAR-II) and speculative resources are also defined. EAR-II refers to uranium that is expected to occur in deposits for which the evidence is inferred from like mineral deposits. By comparison, spec­ ulative resources are those based on indirect evidence and extrapolation and that consist of the quantity of uranium that conceivably could be discovered in areas geologically fav orable for the location of uranium deposits. It is estimated that 11 million tons of uranium may be in the speculative category worldwide. Accord­ ing to the U.S. Department of Energy, the United States may have as much as 1.4 13 Forward cost is a specialized term used to describe the economic availability of uranium resources. It includes the estimated costs of developing, building, and operating uranium mines and mills at the sites of established uranium resources. It does not include the cost of exploration, the cost of money (interest charges), marketing costs, profits, and so forth, which contribute to the price of uranium or U308. As a rule of thumb, the actual market price of uranium is about twice its forward cost.

 text: Sec. 4.6 Nuclear Cycles 199 million tons in this category. However, it is doubtful that much, if any, of these speculative resources will actually be recovered before the year 2025. Besides the conventional uranium resources, there are abundant unconven­ tional resources of low-grade materials. In the United States, for example, there is a geological formation called Chattanooga shale that extends westward from east­ ern Tennessee and underlies at shallow depths much of the areas of half a dozen midwestern states. Much of this shale is rich in uranium (up to about 66 ppm14), but not to an extent that it can be extracted for less than $130 per kg. Neverthe­ less, this shale contains an estimated total of 5 million tons of uranium. Indeed, an area of this shale only 7 miles square contains the energy equivalent to all the petroleum in the world. Similar deposits in alum shale in Sweden were actually mined at one time and produced significant amounts of uranium. The mining was halted, however, because of environmental concerns. More recently, additional fissile material from the former Soviet Union and the U.S. weapons programs have become available. In the form of highly enriched uranium and plutonium, these materials are now being considered as possible fuels for commercial reactors. The consumption of these materials in a reactor has been cited as the best way to dispose of the weapons grade material. Sea water also contains a virtually unlimited amount of uranium but at a very low concentration-about 0.003 ppm. No economically feasible method for its ex­ traction has yet been devised. Estimates of uranium resources, proven and speculative, are not directly re­ lated to the availability of uranium in the marketplace for consumption in nuclear plants. Uranium in the ground, espe cially uranium in the speculative category, ob­ viously cannot be used to fuel reactors. Mines must first be developed, mills must be constructed and placed into operation, transportation must be arranged, and so on. All of this requires the investment of effort and capital long before the de­ mand for fuel has been firmly established. Needless to say, if uranium production and stockpiles fail to meet the demand, reactors somewhere in the world have to be shut down or reduced in power, and the price of uranium would go up for the others. Several studies of uranium supply and demand have been carried out, espe­ cially in connection with the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation exercise and the periodic uranium resources, production, and demand assessment by the OECD and IAEA. These studies show that, unti l about 1990, an oversupply of uranium existed. The oversupply was caused mainly by an overly optimistic esti­ mate of uranium utilization. For example, studies cited in the second edition of this book predicted between 255 and 395 GWe of nuclear-generating capacity in the United States alone. These estimates should be compared with the actual level of 14The average grade of ore processed in the United States in 1978 contained about 1,400 ppm.

page number: 218
 text: 200 Nuclear Reactors and Nuclear Power Chap.4 100 OWe of nuclear-generating capacity. Similar high estimates were also made for the nuclear-generating capacity worldwide. Since 1990, reductions have occurred in uranium production and explo­ ration. While uranium requirements have continued to increase, production has contracted. The difference between production and requirements since 1990 was met by a draw down of existing stockpiles. The imbalance between production and requirements has also led to a rebound in market price for uranium since 1995. Although it is possible to predict short-term requirements for uranium, a number of uncertainties in the long-term uranium market have recently been in­ troduced. These include the decision to convert high-enrichment uranium from warheads to low-enriched uranium by blending and the availability of uranium from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Block countries. After the breakup of the Soviet Union and independence of the former Eastern Block countries, pro­ duction in these areas declined drastically. Prior to the breakup, these countries had considerable excess production. Because of facility closures and environmen­ tal concerns, it is uncertain whether these countries' production capabilities will ever be regained. At present, insufficient uranium production capability exists to meet present and future requirements. The demand for uranium is being met by a combination of production and utilization of the excess inventory built prior to 1991. This could eventually lead to a destabilization of the uranium market, resulting in significantly higher prices for uranium. The HEU from both the United States and former Soviet Union nuclear weapons may help alleviate the shortfall. In 1997, the U.S. and Russian govern­ ments signed an agreement under which Russian HEU would be blended down to LEU for commercial reactor application. It is expected that similar efforts will occur in the United States as well. The first shipments of LEU converted from HEU were delivered to the U.S. Enrichment Corporation in 1995. Eventually plu­ tonium from nuclear weapons will also be available for use in mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel. Some European reactors are already licensed to use MOX fuel derived from recycling of fissile reactor material. Recycled material may also play an important role in meeting demand. Al­ though at current uranium prices, recycled material is too costly, future price in­ creases may eventually negate this difference. It is estimated that over 150,000 tons of heavy metal are stored in spent fuel. This material represents a significant resource that could be used. Further, the removal from the waste stream of the un­ burnt plutonium and fissile uranium will help the concerns over long-term waste disposal. Changes on the demand sid e may also impact the imbalance . In recent years, there has been a trend toward improved fuel utilization through better, more ef­ ficient fuel design as well as improved fuel management. A negative impa.ct on

Recently, there has been a growing realization that nuclear energy is environmentally friendly, producing no acid rain, green hou se gasses, or ozone-depleting emissions. As Third World countries accelerate their economies, it is expected that the per capita consumption of electricity will rise. Many such countries are looking toward nuclear-based generation to meet these energy needs. Only if the breeder option were adopted would the total capacity no longer be resource limited. Initially, the growth in breeder capacity is determined by the growth in electrical demand, the construction capability of industry, and the avail­ ability of plutonium from LWRs for fueling new breeders. Eventually, the breeders would provide sufficient plutonium for fueling new breeders. Beyond this point in time, indicated by the sharp break in the breeder curves, the rate of increase in capacity is very rapid, determined only by the doubling time of the reactors. As discussed in Section 4.5, this is shorter for carbide than for oxide fuel. 4.7 ISOTOPE SEPARATION The problem of enriching uranium is a formidable one because it requires the sep­ aration of two isotopes, 235U and 238U, which have nearly the same atomic weight. Ordinary chemical separation is out of the question, of course, since both isotopes are the same element- uranium. Separation must be accomplished, therefore, by physical means, and several proce sses have been developed for this purpose. Be­ fore describing some of these processes, it is useful to consider some of the basic relationships that underlie isotope separation. Material Balance and Separative Work The amount of starting or input material (i.e., feed material) that must be furnished to an enrichment plant to obtain a given amount of enriched product depends on the original enrichment of the feed, the desired enrichment of the product, and the enrichment of the residual, depleted uranium, or tails. Specifica lly, suppose it is required to produce Mp kg of uranium enriched to Xp weight fraction 15 in 235U from MF kg of feed with enrichment XF, leaving behind MT kg of tails of enrichment XT. The overall material flow is depicted in Fig. 4.44. Since there is little or no loss of uranium in the plant, it follows that (4.32) 15 Although isotope abundance is always given in atom percent, uranium enrichment is speci­ fied in weight percent or weight fraction. The isotope abundance of235U in natural uranium is 0.72%. This corresponds to an enrichment of 0.711 W /0 or a weight fraction of 0.00711.

The total amount of 235U is also the same before and after enrichment, so that Eliminating MT from the last two equations gives (Xp -XT) MF = Mp. XF -XT (4.33) If the feed is natural uranium, then the value of XF is fixed by nature at 0.00711. The value of XT is set by the operator of the enrichment plant. At this writing, the enrichment plants in the United States are operating with XT = 0.002-that is, 0.2 w/o. The denominator in Eq. (4.33) is therefore constant, and it follows that the amount of feed needed to produce a specified amount of product increases linearly with the enrichment. Except for very low enrichments, M F is directly pro­portional to Xp. The variation of MF/ Mp with enrichment is shown in Fig. 4.45. At the enrichment Xp, the mass of 235U in the product mass Mp is Substituting for Mp in Eq. (4.33) then gives _ (xp -XT) M25 MF- -. XF -XT Xp Except for low enrichments, Xp -XT ::: Xp, so that With XF = 0.00711 and XT = 0.002, this gives (4.34) Thus, as stated earlier in Section 4.6, the order of 200 kg (or 200 atoms) of natural uranium feed are required to produce enriched fuel containing 1 kg (or 1 atom) of 235U, almost independent of the fuel's enrichment. It is shown in Section 4.6 that this circumstance has considerable bearing on the utilization of natural uranium resources in nonbreeding reactors.

This concept is based on the observation that isotope separation is equivalent to the unmixing of gases that had been previously irreversibly mixed. Since separated isotopes represent a more ordered situation than unseparated isotopes, the entropy of the former is clearly smaller than that of the latter. According to the laws of thermodyna mics, work must be performed on a system to decrease its entropy in an isothermal process. Therefore, it follows that work must be performed to separate isotopes, and this work is measured in SWU. Separative work can be expressed in terms of a function V (x) known as the value junction, given by (1 -x) Vex) = (1 -2x) In - x-, (4.35)

The separative work associated with the production of a given amount of product material is defined as the increase in total value of the product and tails, taken together, over the value of the feed. Specifically, if Mp kg of product are produced from MF kg of feed, with a residual of MT kg of tails, the separative work is (4.36) where Xp, XT, and XF are the respective enrichments . However, since Eq. (4.36) can be written as (4.37) It should be noted that SWU has units of mass (kilogram s). For fixed values of XF and XT, the separative work necessary to produce a given amount of product increases monotonically with enrichment. This is illustrated in Fig. 4.45, where SWUI Mp is plotted as a function of Xp. Example 4.6 One third of the core of a PWR is removed and replaced with fresh fuel approx­ imately once a year. Por a nominal 1,000 MWe PWR plant, each reload requires about 33,000 kg of 3.2 wlo-enriched V02. If the feed to the enrichment plant is 16It can be shown that V (x) is proportional to the total amount of fluid that has to be pumped in all stages of a separation system per unit amount of material processed.

(b) How much would the enrichment cost at the 1981 U.S. price of $130.75 per kg SWU? Solution. 1. There are 238 238 + 2 x 16 x 33,000 = 29,089 kg of enriched uranium in 33,000 kg of U02. Using Xp = 0.032, Xp = 0.00711, and XT = 0.002 in Eq. (4.33) gives 0.032 -0.002 Mp = 0.00711 _ 0.002 x 29,089 = 170,777 kg [Ans.] 2. The value of the 3.2 wlo uranium is (1 -0.032) V (0.032) = (1 - 2 x 0.032) In 0.032 = 3.19l. Similarly, V(0.00711) = 4.869 and V(0.002) = 6.188. From Eq. (4.36), the separative work is SWU = 29,089(3.191 -6.188 -170,777(4.869 -6.188) = 138, 075 kg. At $130.75 per SWU, the charge for enrichment would be 138,075 x 130.75 = $18,053, 306.[Ans.] It is of some interest to consider the variation of feed and separative work requirements with the residual enrichment of the tails. As shown in Fig. 4.47, the feed requirements decrease with decreasing tails enrichment for fixed values of XF and Xp. This would be expected since decreasing tails enrichment means that more 235U is extracted per kg of feed. However, the SWU required to produce a given product goes up with decreasing tails enrichment simply because it takes more work to extract more 235U out of a given mass of feed. Whether it makes sense to increase or decrease tai ls enrichment at any time depends on the relative costs of separative work and uranium feed, on the one hand, and the desire to conserve nat­ ural uranium resources, on the other. For instance, in producing "" 3 wi 0 uranium for LWRs, a reduction in tails enrichment from 0.20 wlo to 0.10 wlo would lead to a saving of about 15% in feed, but this would increase the SWU per kg of prod­ uct by 43%. Therefore, a decrease in tails assay would not be indicated until the ratio of the cost of uranium to separative work increases substantially or a shortfall in uranium supply appears imminent.

The rate at which an enrichment facility can produce enriched uranium is de­termined by its ability to deliver separative work in a unit of time. Accordingly, enrichment plant capacities are measured in SWU/yr or, more appropriately, in millions of SWU/yr. Clearly, the greater the separative work capacity, the more reactors can be serviced by a given facility or facilities. For example, in 1983, the U.S. government had 27.3 million SWU/yr of separative capacity in operation. Ap­proximately 116,000 SWU/yr are needed to fuel a 1,000 MWe PWR (aside from the initial loading; see Problem 4.33). It follows that U.S. enrichment plants will be capable of handling the fuel needs of 27.3 x 106/116,000 = 235 one thou­sand MWe PWRs for a total electrical capacity of 235 GWe. Today, this represents an excess in capacity despite the sale of fuel on the international market and is therefore being reduced. Uranium Enrichment Processes At least a dozen methods have been devised for the separation of isotopes, but only a few have been shown to be economically practical or hold promise of becoming so. Some of the more prominent of these methods are considered briefly.

 text: Sec. 4.7 Isotope Separation 207 Gaseous Diffusion The first economic enrichment process to be success­ fully developed was the gaseous diffusion method. This process is based on the observation that, in a mixture of two gases, on average the lighter molecules travel faster than the heavier molecules. As a result, the lighter molecules strike the walls of a container more frequently than their heavier counterpar ts. If a portion of the container consists of a porous material having holes large enough to permit the passage of individual gas molecules, but not so large that a mass flow-through of the gas can occur, then more light molecules than heavy molecules will pass out of the container. The gas leaving the container is therefore somewhat enriched in the lighter molecules, whereas the residual gas is correspondingly depleted. This phe­ nomenon is illustrated in Fig. 4.48, which shows the actual type of container, bar­ rier configuration, and piping connections used in some gaseous diffusion plants. A single container like that shown in the figure is called a diffuser. Uranium, of course, is not a gas, and the diffusion enrichment of uranium is carried out using uranium hexaflouride, UF6. Although this substance is a solid at room temperature, it is easily vaporized. However, this requires that all components of a diffusion plant be maintained at an appropriate temperature to ensure that the UF6 remains in gaseous form. Although UF6 is a stable compound, it is highly reac­ tive with water and corrosive to most common metals. As a consequence, internal gaseous pathways must be fabricated from nickel, or austenitic stainless steel, and the entire system must be leak tight. Despite its unpleasant characteri stics, UF6 is the only compound of uranium sufficiently volatile to be used in the gaseous diffusion process. Fortunately, fluorine only consists of the single isotope 19F, so that the differ­ ence in molecular weights of different molecules of UF6 is only due to the differ- UF6 feed o o o o o o o o o o o o o o Enriched �=� in23sU ...... Figure 4.48 Operation of a diffuser in a gaseous diffusion process.

 text: 208 Nuclear Reactors and Nuclear Power Chap. 4 ence in weights of the uranium isotopes. However, because the molecular weights of 235UF6 and 238UF6 are so nearly equal, very little separation of the 235UF6 and 238UF6 is affected by a single pass through a barrier (i.e., in one diffuser). It is necessary, therefore, to connect a great many diffusers together in a sequence of stages, using the outputs of each stage as the inputs for two adjoining stages, as shown in Fig. 4.49. Such a sequence of stages is called a cascade. In practice, diffusion cascades require thousands of stages depending on the desired product enrichment. As indicated in Fig. 4.49, the gas must be compressed at each stage to make up for a loss in pressure across the diffuser. This leads to compression heating of the gas, which then must be cooled before entering the diffuser. The requirements for pumping and cooling make diffusion plants enormous consumers of electricity. For instance, a plant capacity of 10 million SWU/yr requires about 2,700 MW of Figure 4.49 Three stages of a gaseous diffusion cascade. (U.S. Depart­ ment of Energy. )

Although this is the principle method used today in the United States, other countries have developed this technology. China, France, and Argentina have all built prototype or large-scale plants using this method. Gas Centrifu ge The gas centrifuge process for separating isotopes is a sophistica ted version of the common method used for many years in biology and medicine for fractionating blood and other biological specimens. Historically, cen­ trifuging was one of the first processes considered for enriching uranium for mil­ itary purposes in World War II, and it was carried to the pilot plant stage before being abandoned in favor of gaseous diffusion. The separation of the isotopes of chlorine had already been successfully demonst rated in the 1930s by J. W. Beams at the University of Virginia. In the gas centrifuge method, the gases to be separated-namely, 235UF6 and 238UF6-are placed in an appropriate container or rotor and rotated at high speed. The rotation creates what is, in effect, a strong gravitational field. As a result, the heavier gas tends to move to the periphery of the vessel, whereas the lighter gas ac­ cumulates nearer the center-buoyed by the heavier gas. The amount of separation that can be attained in a single centrifuge machine depends on the mass difference between the two gas components, the length of the rotor, and, most important, its speed of rotation. The basic principles of the centrifuge are shown in Fig. 4.50, provided by the U.S. Department of Energy. The electromagnetically driven rotor is located in an evacuated chamber. UF6 is fed into the rotor at the axis, and the en­ riched and depleted fractions are withdrawn near the top and bottom of the rotor, as shown. An important feature in the operation of an isotope-se parating centrifuge is that an axial countercurrent of the gas is maintained within the rotor, as indicated in the figure, by the establishment of a temperature difference between the ends of the rotor and/or the appropriate mechanical design of the 2 output scoops. As the gas moves upward near the rotor axis, the 238UF6 diffuses toward the outer wall. The gas arriving at the upper scoop is therefore slightly enriched in 235UF6; similarly, the stream reaching the lower scoop is depleted in 235UF6. Since the rate of gas flow through one centrifuge is not large, a great many machines must be connected in parallel in a commercial-size enrichment plant. Also, because the necessary degree of enrichment cannot be carried out in a single centrifuge, the machines must be connected together in cascade as in a gaseous diffusion plant. The principle advantage of the gas centrifuge method over gaseous diffusion is that, according to the U.S. Department of Energy, a gas centrifuge plant uses only 96% less electric power than a gaseous diffuson plant of the same separative work capacity. Thus, although a nominal 10 million SWU/yr diffusion plant requires

Several countries have developed enrichment facilities based on the cen­ trifuge process. These include the United Kingdom, Russia, China, Pakistan, India, Brazil, Germany, The Netherlands, Japan, and possibly Iran and Israel. Aerod ynamic Processes Aerodynamic processes exploit the small dif­ ferences in mass between 238U and 235U bearing molecules in much the same way as gaseous diff usion plants operate. To date, two methods have been tried at least in a prototype manner-the Becker nozzle and the aerodynamic process. The Becker nozzle was devised by E. W. Becker ill the Federal Republic of Germany. In this process, a mixture of UF6 and hydrogen flows at supersonic speeds through a specially designed curved nozzle as shown in Fig. 4.51. Due to the centrifugal pressure gradient created in the gas, th€ h€avi€r mol€cul€s t€nd to

The emerging gas can therefore be separated into lighter and heavier fractions by placing a sharp divider at an appropriate location on the far side of the nozzle. It has been shown that the nozzle process provides a much larger degree of separation per stage than the gaseous diffusion process. Unfortunately, the process was not found competitive with other methods. The Republic of South Africa has developed enrichment facilities based on a similar concept to the Becker nozzle. In the aerodynamic process, uranium hex­ aftouride gas and hydrogen enters a tube at high speed through holes in the side. The gas spirals down the tube. The tube narrows along the axis, and the heavier fraction, rich in 238U, exits to the side. The lighter fraction exits through the bot­ tom. The plant successfully operated for several years, but proved uneconomical. Electromagne tic Separation This method is an extension on a large scale of the principle of the mass spectrometer. Ionized uranium gas is accelerated by an electrical potential into a magnetic field, where the more massive particles travel in arcs of larger radii than the lighter particles. The separated beams are then collected in properly spaced graphite receivers. The uranium ions react with the graphite and form uranium carbide, which is then chemically treated to obtain the separated isotopes. One of the obvious advantages of the electromagnetic process is that virtually complete separation of the uranium isotopes can be obtained in one pass through the machine. A large pilot plant was placed in operation in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, during World War II. The Iraqi government also chose this method for their clan-

 text: 212 Nuclear Reactors and Nuclear Power Chap. 4 destine nuclear program. However, the method is less economical than gaseous diffusion plants for enriching uranium. Today it yields small laboratory amounts of elements enriched in particular isotopes but was actively pursued by Iraq for its weapons program. Laser Isotope Separation The newest and most ingenious method for separating isotopes relies on laser tech­ nology and the light-absorbing properties of atoms or molecules. The science of laser optics lies outside the scope of this book; suffice it to say that lasers have the unique ability to produce intense beams of light of well-defined frequencies-that is, beams of essentially monochromatic light. As explained in Chapter 2, atoms normally exist in their ground states, but they can be placed in excited states by absorption of apprppriate amounts of energy. Molecules, like atoms, also have a ground state and excited states. Whereas the ex­ cited states of atoms are due to different configurations of electrons, the states in molecules may also arise because of different vibratiopal Of rotational energies of the molecular structure. In either case, the absorption of electromagnetic radiation occurs in the same way. If the energy of the incident radiation does not correspond to a possible transition between states, very little absorption occurs; when the in­ cident energy matches a possible transition, considerable energy absorption may result. This phenomenon of resonance absorption is shown in Fig. 4.52 for excita­ tion resonances in 235U and 238U at approximately 5,027 angstroms (l angstrom= 1 10-13.----------------------------� t:: 10-14 .g U 10-15 � �N 10-16 § 8 § S 10-17 ._ 0 rg � 10-18 .- I-< U <1.) � 0...10-19 ca .s.. 10-20 � Laser bandwidth 10-21 10-22UL---�---L---�----L---�---L---�-� 5027.1 5027.2 5027.3 5027.4 Wavelength, angstroms Figure 4.52 Excitation cross-section as a function of wavelength.

 text: Sec. 4.7 Isotope Separation 213 A = 10-8 cm), the wavelength of green light, which corresponds to annihilation incident photon energy of about 2.4 e V. Laser isotope separation (LIS) is based on the fact that the energies of the excitated states of atoms and molecules depend to some degree on their atomic masses. This is reflected in a shift, known as the isotope shift, in the energies of the excitation resonances. In the case of uranium atoms, as indicated in Fig. 4.52, the resonances shown in 235U and 238U are separated by about 0.1 A. By exposing uranium vapor to a laser beam having a bandwidth (i.e., a variation in wavelength) less than 0.1 A, it is possible to place the 235U in an excited state while leaving the 238U in its ground state. Subsequent exposure of the vapor to other laser beams can then raise the energy of the excited 235U to a point where the atom becomes iunized. In principle, the charged ion can then be extracted by electron fields from the system without disturbing the neutral 238U. The mechanism just described relates to separation effected with individual atoms, and it is sometimes referred to as atomic vapor LIS (AVLIS). A similar method based on the selective excitation and decomposition of UF6 gas is called molecular LIS (MLIS). Both techniques are being rapidly developed in major lab­ oratories around the world. The main components of one proposed AVLIS chamber are indicated in Fig. 4.53. Molten metallic uranium contained in the water-cooled crucible at the bottom of the unit is vaporized by exposure to an intense beam of high-energy electrons. The vapor expands rapidly into the chamber and enters the extraction structure, consisting of a number of parallel plates. Here it is exposed to four intense laser beams-the choice of four different beams is based on the detailed physics of the optical excitation of uranium. The lasers selectively ionize a portion of the 235U atoms, which are drawn to the product collector plates by electric and magnetic fields. The neutral 238U atoms pass through the product collectors to the tails col­ lector. However, all the atoms falling on the product collectors are not solely 235U. Much of the material that accumulates on the collectors is simply uranium vapor, which has flowed directly to the collecting plates from the crucible source. The uranium collected is therefore enriched in 235U, but is not pure 235U. For the sake of clarity, only one laser beam and mirror are shown in Fig. 4.53; in fact, several beams, reflected repeatedly within the chamber, are used to increase the utilization of laser energy. To further increase laser utilization, several chambers are connected in series so the beams traverse each in turn. The overall energy consumption of an AVLIS plant is estimated to be less than one tenth that of a gaseous diffusion plant of the same capacity. For complex reasons, the AVLIS system operates most satisfactorily at low­ feed enrichments, with either natural uranium or depleted uranium. Thus, the pro­ posed pilot plant could use depleted uranium (enrichment 0.2-0.3 W /0) to produce 3 W /o-enriched uranium for use in LWRs, leaving a tails enrichment of 0.08 W / o.

(Courtesy of Jersey Nuc1ear-Avco Isotopes, Inc.) Chap. 4 Operating on natural uranium, the AVLIS system would increase the availability of 235U for LWRs by about 18% (see Problem 4.39). Other Processes There are two other competing processes that may prove more economical than current techniques. Although still under development, these methods are considered technically feasible and potentially commercially vi­ able. The methods are chemical exchange and plasma separation. The chemical exchange process relies on the behavior of molecules bear­ ing the heavier 238U atom to be different from that of the lighter 235U-bearing molecules. Thus, in certain reactions, one isotope tends to concentrate in one molecule over another. The process is similar to the enrichment of water in deu­ terium discussed later. The second process relies on the cyclotron frequency of 235U being different from that of 238U. This difference allows the ions of one species to be preferentially collected over the other. Production of Heavy Water Up to this point, the discussion of isotope separation has centered on the problem of producing enriched uranium to fuel reactors moderated or cooled with ordinary

 text: Sec. 4.7 Isotope Separation 215 water. As explained earlier, such reactors cannot be made critical with natural ura­ nium. However, natural uranium can be used as fuel in heavy-wa ter moderated reactors such as CANDU and the Argentine reactors at Atucha (see Section 4.5). With these reactors, the burden of isotope separation lies in producing the heavy water, rather than in enriching the fuel. If heavy water is used both as the mod­ erator and coolant, approximately one metric ton is required per MWe of nuclear plant capacity. Heavy water has been produced commercially by a variety of meth­ ods, including electrolysis, distillation of water or liquid hydrogen, and a method of chemical exchange described later. This last method has come to be preferred because it uses an abundant feed material (water) and requires little energy. Because they possess the same number of protons and electrons, isotopes of the same element are normally assumed to be chemically identical. However, such isotopes may not undergo chemical reactions at precisely the same rate, owing to differences in their atomic mass. Naturally the difference in reaction rates increases with the disparity among the isotopic masses, and it is most pronounced in the case of ordinary hydrogen and deuterium, whose masses differ by a factor of two. Consider, for example, the reaction between deuterated hydrogen sulfide and water: If Hand D were chemically the same, the equilibrium constant for the reaction K = _[H_D_O_H_H_2S_1 [H20][HDS] where the brackets denote concentration, would be equal to unity. Actually, K is substantially greater than unity and is also a function of temperature. Thus, at 25°C, K is 2.37; at 125°C, K is 1.84. By writing K in the form K = [HDOHH 2S] [HDSHH 20] , it is clear that, in equilibrium, the concentration of HDO in H 20 is greater than that of HDS in H2S. What is more, the relative concentration of HDS in H20 in­ creases with increasing temperature. These circumstances make it possible to sepa­ rate D from H and underlie the so-called GS dual-temperature exchange process17 by which most heavy water is produced commercially. The OS process takes place in a chemical exchange tower where H2S gas is bubbled upward through a sequence of perforated trays, along and around which 17 Although the GS process was invented by K. Geib and 1. S. Spevack, the initials GS evidently refer to Girdler-Sulfide, Girdler being the name of the company that designed the first GS plant in the United States.

The tower is divided into two parts: a hot section (T � 125°C) and a cold (cooler) section (T� 32°C). Since the equi­librium concentration of deuterium in the H2S leaving the hot section is greater than it is leaving the cold section, it follows that there is a net transfer of D from the HDO to the H20 in the cold section. The overall effect is that D is carried around the tower and enriches the feedwater in the cold section. In short, the water is enriched in the cold section; the H2S is reconstituted in the hot section. Some of the enriched water is extracted at the junction of the two sections and passes into additional separation towers. By adjusting the water and H2S flow rates, the H2S can be entirely reconstituted within the tower. In some versions of the as process, especially those used in Canada, the enriched gas rather than the enriched water is carried forward to additional towers until at the last tower the enriched water is finally withdrawn.

Further enrichment to 99.75 W /0 required in CAND U s is carried out using vacuum distillation. 4.8 FUEL REPROCESSING In an LWR fuel cycle with recycle or in any breeder reactor cycle, it is necessary to reprocess the spent fuel to recover the plutonium or uranium. Several methods have been developed over the years to do so. However, virtually all reprocessing plants that have been built since the 1950s utilize the Purex solvent extraction process. The Purex process is based on the following experimental facts. Uranium and plutonium can exist in a number of valence (oxidation) states. Because of differ­ ences in their oxidation and reduction potentials, it is possible to oxidize or re­ duce one of these elements without disturbing the other. Furthermore, compounds of uranium and plutonium in different states have different solubilities in organic solvents. For instance, in the 4+ and 6+ states, the nitrates of both uranium and plutonium are soluble in certain solvents, while in the 3+ state their compounds are virtually insoluble in the same solvents . Therefore, solvent extraction involves three critical steps: (a) separating the uranium and plutonium from the fission products by absorbing the first two in the appropriate solvent, leaving the latter in solution; (b) reducing the oxidation state of the plutonium to 3+ so that it is no longer soluble in the solvent; and (c) back­ extracting the plutonium into aqueous solution. A simplified flow diagram for a Purex reprocessing plant is shown in Fig. 4.55. The fuel rods are first cut into short 1engths-3 to 5 cm long. This occurs in the so-called mechanical head-end of the plant. The chopped pieces are next heated to remove radioactive gases, mostly tritium and the fission product gas 85Kr, trapped within the fuel. These gases are collected and stored. The batch of fuel is then dissolved in a concentrated solution of nitric acid (HN03). This aqueous solution of uranium and plutonium, both of which at this point are in high states of oxidation, together with the fission products and dis­ solved remnants of the fuel assemblies, next passes through a filter to remove undissolved components of the assemblies and enters at the middle of the first extraction column. In this column, the organic solvent tributylphosphate (TBP), diluted in the kerosenelike substance dodecane, flows up the column extracting uranium and plu­ tonium from the aqueous solution. At the same time, more nitric acid enters from the top of the column to scrub the rising solvent of any fission products that it may have picked up. The organic solution that leaves the top of the column con­ tains essentially all the uranium and plutonium and only a trace of fission products,

The organic solution passes next into a second column, where it counterflows against a dilute solution of a chemical-reducing agent (a ferrous compound is often used), which reduces the plutonium to the 3+ state, but leaves the uranium in the 6+ state. Since the plutonium is no longer soluble in the TBP, it passes into the aqueous solution before leaving the column. The uranium is stripped from the organic solvent in a third column, where it passes into a counterftowing stream of dilute nitric acid. The solvent leaving the top of the column, from which most of the plutonium, uranium, and fission products have now been removed, is piped to a recovery plant for purification and reuse. The uranium exits the column in aqueous solution. To further purify the uranium and plutonium fractions, their respective solu­ tions can be processed through additional extraction columns. However, the plu­ tonium is often purified and concentrated by ion exchange. This process involves passing the plutonium solution into an ion exchange resin and then eluting the plu­ tonium with dilute acid. The concentration of the purified plutonium can then be increased by partially evaporating the solution, taking Care not to approach critical­ ity. This is the usual form of the plutonium output from a fuel reprocessing plant-a highly purified solution of plutonium nitrate. It is an easy matter to transfonn the plutonium to the oxide PU02.

 text: Sec. 4.9 Radioactive Waste Disposal 219 4.9 RADIOACTIVE WASTE DISPOSAL Radioactive wastes in several different forms are produced at various points in the fuel cycle of a nuclear power plant: during the mining of uranium, the manufacture of the fuel, the operation of the reactor, and the processing and recycling of the fuel (if this is part of the cycle). Wastes are also produced when the plant is ulti­ mately decommissioned and dismantled. The nuclear power industry is not the sole purveyor of radioactive wastes, however. Hospitals have become a major source of such wastes due to the widespread use of radiopharmaceut icals in medicine. Ra­ dioactive wastes are also a significant by-product of nuclear weapons programs. It is usual to classify waste in four categories. High-level waste consists of spent fuel, if this is discarded as waste, and any wastes generated in the first stages of a fuel reprocessing plant (since this waste contains the bulk of the fission prod­ ucts). Transuranic (TRU) waste consists mostly of the isotopes of plutonium at concentrations in excess of 10-9 Ci/g; TRU wastes are generated by fuel reprocess­ ing, plutonium fuel fabrication, and manufacturing of nuclea r weapons. Low-level waste contains less than 10-9 Ci/g of TRU nuclides. It also includes material that is free of TRU and requires little or no shielding, but it is still potentially dangerou s. Mine and mill tailings consist of residues from uranium mining and milling op­ erations; such residues contain low concentrations of naturally occurring radionu­ clides. A perusal of the chart of nuclides reveals that the vast majority of the several hundred fission products are very short-lived. Only five have half-lives between 1 and 5 years; two-namely, 90Sr and 137Cs-have half-lives of about 30 years, and three-93Zr, 1291, and 135Cs-have half-lives in excess of a million years, and hence are effectively stable. In 100 years, the activity of a 5-year nuclide decreases by a factor of 106, and the shorter lived nuclides disappear altogether. Over the long­ term, therefore, the fission product activity of high-level waste is due only to 90Sr and 137Cs. The latter radionuclide decays into stable 137Ba. However, 90Sr decays to 90y, which decays with a 64-hr half-life to stable 90Zr. Thus, high-level waste ultimately contains three fission products, 90Sr, 90y and 137CS. The half-lives of many of the TRU nuclides tend to be considerably longer. For instance, the half-life TI/2 of 239pu is 24,000 years. Therefore, the activity of these nuclides dies off more slowly than that of the fission products. In the spent fuel from a typical LWR, the TRU activity exceeds the fission product activity after approximately 700 years. The total high-level activity from spent fuel, including both the fission prod­ ucts and the TRU nuclides, depends on the nature of the reactor fuel cycle. With the once-through cycle, the activity of the fuel persists for hundreds of thousands of years owing to the presence of TRU material. However, with a closed cycle,

(Based on Nuclear Proliferation and Civilian Nuclear Power, U.S. Department of Energy report DOEINE-000 l/9, Volume 9, 1980.) the plutonium isotopes are returned to the reactor where, on fissioning, they are transformed into short-lived fission products. This situation is illustrated in Fig. 4.56, where the activity of high-level waste generated in 1 GWE year is shown for the LWR with and without recycling; for the LMFBR (with recycling, of course) and for a special case in which LWR spent fuel is reprocessed, the fission products are treated as waste and the plutonium is merely stored. Except in the early and late years, the activity in this last cycle is due almost entirely to 90Sr, 90y, and 137 Cs. Also shown in the figure is the range of activities of the uranium ore required to produce the original fuel. It is observed that the high-level activity associated with the fuel cycles approaches w1thin an order of magnitude of the ore in about 1,000 years. 18 18 A more fair comparison of ore and high-level waste should take into account the relative toxicity of the heavy elements, which decay in large part by a -emission, with that of fission products, which emit f3-rays. The toxicity of a-emitters is about 10 times greater than that of f3-rays (see Section 9.2).

 text: Sec. 4.9 Radioactive Waste Disposa\ 221 Most of the high-level waste in the world today is a by-product of nuclear weapons program s. For the most part, pending permanent disposal, this waste is either stored in liquid form in large tanks or is being solidified to reduce the pos­ sibility of leakage. Increasing amounts of high-level waste are also accumula ting in the spent-fuel pools of nuclear power plants. Commercial reprocessing of spent fuel is occurring in a number of foreign countries. However, because of prolifera­ tion concerns, the United States is not participating. How commercial high-level waste is disposed of clearly depends on whether or not spent fuel is reprocessed. With no reprocessing, the fuel may be disposed of intact. Presumably this would be done by placing the spent fuel assemblies in suitable containers and burying these containers in some stable geological setting. Historically, stable rock formations have been considered for this purpose. If the fuel is reprocessed and the plutonium is recycled (or stored), the dis­ posal problem becomes more manageable and susceptible to unique technological solution. Since fission products represent a small fraction of the mass of the fuel, reprocessing substantially reduces the volume of the waste. The waste, in liquid fonn, can then be calcinated-that is, dried at high temperature; mixed with jrit, the substance from which glass is made; and then vitrified-that is, made into glass. Another newer technique involves surrounding beads of waste with layers of ce­ ramic as in the fabrication of HTGR fuel. These and similar methods for solidifying the waste effectively immobilize the radioactive particles, something that cannot be done as easily with unprocessed spent fuel. The glass or ceramic complexes are fi­ nally placed in cannisters and deposited in stable geological formations. If a canister holding either a whole fuel assembly or solidified waste should disintegrate, even soon after its emplacement in a repository, there is good reason to believe that the fission products and TRU nuc1ides would not diffuse far into the environment. Strong support for this contention is furnished by what has be­ come known as the Oklo phenomenon. Oklo is the name of a uranium mine in the African nation of Gabon, where France obtains much of the uranium for its nuclear program. When uranium from this mine was introduced into a French gaseous dif­ fusion plant, it was discovered that the feed uranium was already depleted below the 0.711 W /0 of ordinary natural uranium. It was as if the uranium had already been used to fuel some unknown reactor. And so it had. French scientists found traces of fission products and TRU waste at various locations within the mine. These observations were puzzling at first because it is not possible to make a reactor go critical with natural uranium, except under very special circumstances with a graphite or heavy-wa ter moderator, neither of which could reasonably be expected to have ever been present in the vicinity of Oklo. The explanation of the phenomenon is to be found in the fact that the half-life of 235U, 7.13 x 108 years, is considerably shorter than the half-life of 238U, 4.51 x 109 years. Since the original formation of the earth, more 235U has

 text: 222 Nuclear Reactors and Nuclear Power Chap. 4 therefore decayed than 238U. This, in tum, means that the enrichment of natural uranium was greater years ago than it is today. Indeed, it is easy to show (see Prob­ lem 2.37) that about 3 billion years ago this enrichment was in the neighborhood of 3 w / a-sufficiently high to form a critical assembly with ordinary water, which is known to have been present near Oklo at that time. The relevance of the Oklo phenomenon to present-day disposal of radioactive wastes is that neither the fission products (identified by their stable daughters) nor the plutonium migrated from the Oklo site in the billions of years since the reactor was critical. Compared with high-level waste, low-level waste represents more of a nui­ sance than a hazard. However, it comprises a much larger volume. A nominal 1,000 MWe LWR power plant produces the order of 100 m3 of solid low-level waste, mostly contamina ted laundry wastes, protective clothing, glassware, tools, con­ tainers, and so on, and somewhat higher level waste in the form of spent resins from reactor coolant demineral izers, air filters, and so on. Such wastes are nor­ mally placed in drums and shipped off-site to waste depositories, where the drums, several hundred per GWe-year, are buried. Liquid low-level wastes are usually so­ lidified or retained for decay, diluted, and discharged to the environment. In terms of total activity, a typical large hospital generates more low-level waste than a nuclear power plant. The bulk of this activity is due to 3H and 14C; the remainder consists of short-lived nuclides that quickly decay. Fortunately, the total amount of 3H and 14C originating in medical institutions is trivial compared with their natural production rates in the atmosphere from cosmic rays (see Section 9.7). At least in principle, these wastes can safely be incinerated, although, for political reasons, this procedure has not been generally adopted. The major source of concern from uranium mining and mill tailings is the increased release of the radioactive gas radon-in particular, the isotope 222Rn, which has a half-life of 3.8 days. This nuclide is one of the products in the long decay chain beginning with 238U and is the immediate daughter of the decay of 226Ra. Chemically, radon is a noble gas, and therefore it readily diffuses out of solid materials containing uranium or radium. Although radon does not present a health hazard, its longer lived daughters do, especially 210Pb (T1/2 = 19.4 years). When these daughter products, formed by the decay of radon in the atmosphere, are inhaled, they may become attached to the tissues at the base of the bronchial network. Their subsequent decay can lead to lung cancer (see Chap. 9 for further discussion of this process). Disposal of such tailings is either by placement under­ ground, the preferred but more costly method, or by covering the tailings with no less than 3 m of earth and then planting vegetation to prevent erosion.
