 text: 8 Heat Remov al from Nuclear Reactors For a reactor to operate in a steady state, with an internal temperature distribution that is independent of time, all of the heat released in the system must be removed as fast as it is produced. This is accomplished, in all reactors except those operating at very low power levels, by passing a liquid or gaseous coolant through the core and other regions where heat is generated. The nature and operation of this coolant system is one of the most important considerations in the design of a nuclear reac­ tor. The temperature in an operating reactor varies from point to point within the system. As a consequence, there is always one fuel rod, usually one of the rods near the center of the reactor, that at some point along its,length is hotter than all the rest. This maximum fuel temperature is detennined by the power level of the reactor, the design of the coolant system, and the nature of the fuel. However, metallurgical considerations place an upper limit on the temperature to which a fuel rod can safely be raised. Above this temperature, there is a danger that the fuel may melt, which can lead to the rupture of the cladding and release of fission products. One of the major objectives in the design of a reactor coolant system is to provide for the removal of the heat produced at the desired power level while ensuring that the maximum fuel temperature is always below this predetennined value. 403

 text: 404 Heat Removal from Nuclear Reactors Chap. 8 It should be noted that, from a strictly nuclear standpoint, there is no theoreti­ cal upper limit to the power level that can be attained by any critical reactor having sufficient excess reactivity to overcome its negative temperature coefficient. Thus, by removing control rods and placing a reactor on a positive period, its power could be increased indefinitely were it not for the fact that eventually a point would be reached where the coolant system is no longer able to remove all of the heat being produced. Beyond this point, the fuel would heat up and eventually a portion of the core would melt down. This situation is avoided in the actual operation of a reactor by reinserting some of the control rods or adding boron to the shim system to return the reactor to critical when a desired power level has been reached. Throughout the present chapter, it is assumed that the reactors under consideration are critical and operating at a constant power. Before beginning the discussion of the design of reactor coolant systems, a word is in order concerning units. As pointed out in Appendix I, where the matter of units is considered in some detail, the SI system of units has been adopted by most of the nations of the world, with the exception of the United States. All U.S. scientists and many U.S. engineers and engineering societies also use this system. However, there is still strong resistance to the adoption of SI units. As a result, most American manufacturers of nuclear power equipment base their designs on the English system. Since this state of affairs is likely to persist for several years to come, English units are used throughout the present chapter as the primary unit. SI units are provided where appropriate. Tables for conversion from English to SI units are given in Appendix I. 8.1 GENER AL THERM ODYNAMIC CONSIDER ATIONS From a thermodynamic point of view, a nuclear reactor is a device in which energy is produced and transferred to a moving fluid. Thus, as indicated in Fig. 8.1, heat is released in a reactor at the rate of q BTUlhr or watts and absorbed by the coolant, which enters the reactor at the temperature Tin and exits from the reactor at the temperature TOUb passing through the system at the rate of w lblhr or kg/hr. With all power reactors except the BWR and RBMK, there is no (net) change in phase of the coolant as it passes through the reactor; that is, the coolant does not boil. In these reactors, the heat from the reactor merely increases the temperature of the coolant, a process that occurs at essentially constant pressure-namely, the re­ actor coolant pressure. The heat in BTUs or joules required to raise the temperature of a unit mass of coolant from the temperature Tin to Tout is lout . cp(T)dT, In

Since w lb or kg of coolant flows through the reactor per hour, the rate at which heat produced in the reactor is absorbed by the coolant is given by (8.1) Equation (8.1) can also be written in tenns of the thennodynamic function enthalpy. This is defined for a substance by the relation h = u + Pv, (8.2) where h is the enthalpy per unit mass of the substance (or specific enthalpy), u is its internal energy per unit mass, P is the pressure, and v is the specific volume of the substance (i.e., the volume per unit mass ft31lb or m3/kg). The units of h are Btullb or joules/kg. In thennodynami cs, it is shown that when heat is added to a substance at constant pressure, essentially all of the heat is used to increase its enthalpy. 1 Thus, if hio and hout are the specific enthalpies of the coolant entering and leaving the reactor, respectively, it follows that jTOUI hout = hiD + c p (T)dT Tin (8.3) I A very small amount of heat may also be used to increase the kinetic energy of the substance or change its gravitational potential energy by virtue of raising the substance from a lower to a higher level in the earth's gravitational field. However, both of these contributions are negligible for reactor coolants.

 text: 406 Heat Removal from Nuclear Reactors Chap. 8 It also follows that Eq. (8.1) can be written as (8.4) The situation is somewhat more complica ted in the case of a BWR or an RBMK. In these reactors, a portion of the water passing through the core is va­ porized to steam, exits from the reactor via a steam pipe to the turbine, and later returns as feed water from the condenser and reheaters. Most of the water that goes through the core is recirculated within the reactor. However, in steady-st ate operation, there is no net absorption of heat by the recirculating water. Therefore, although the incoming feed water mixes with the recirculating water before pass­ ing through the core, the overall effect of the reactor is simply to vaporize the feed water, as is indicated schematically in Fig. 8.2. The change in enthalpy from the point where the feed water enters a BWR to the point where the steam exits from the reactor consists of two stages. The water is first heated from its entering temperature 'lin to the temperature at which it boils­ that is, the saturation temperature Tsat for the given system pressure. The water temperature does not rise above this value. The associated increase in enthalpy is This is the enthalpy of the saturated water. With the onset of boiling, the water absorbs an amount of heat equal to the heat of vaporization, denoted by h jg' per unit mass of water that changes phase. Thus, the specific enthalpy of the steam is Core Recirculated water Steam Feed water Figure 8.2 Schematic drawing of coolant flow through a BWR.

 text: Sec. 8.1 General Thermodynamic Considerations 407 (8.5) Again, the rate at which heat is absorbed by the coolant is given by Eq. (8.4), where w is the steam or feed water flow rate (the two are equal) in lb/hr or kg/hr. The advantage of expressing q in terms of enthalpy is that h has been com­ puted using Eq. (8.3) or Eq. (8.5) and is available in tabular form for a number of substances. Abridged tables of h (these are called steam tables) are given in Appendix IV for water, helium, and sodium. It should be noted that only the dif­ ference in enthalpy between two different temperatures is meaningful and useful; the absolute value of enthalpy has no meaning. Thus, the zero of enthalpy can be set arbitrarily, and the values of enthalpy computed from this starting point. In the case of water, for example, in the English system of units, h is taken to be zero for the saturated liquid at 32°F or in SI units as O°C. Again, for water, it is observed in Appendix IV that the specific enthalpy is tabulated for saturated water and steam as a function of the temperature , and associated pressure in Table IV. I , and as a function of pressure and the associated temperature in Table IV.2. (It must be remembered that there is only one pressure for a given temperature ; conversely, there is one temperature for a given pressure at which water and steam are in equilibrium -i.e., at which water will boil.) However, the enthalpy of a liquid is not a sensitive function of pressure. Thus, the enthalpy of water in the pressurized water reactor is nearly equal to the value of h indicated in the tables for saturated liquid at the actual water temperature independent of its pressure.2 This procedure is used in the first of the following two examples, which illustrate the use of Eq. (8.4) for PWR and BWR systems. ExampleS.1 A PWR operates at a thermal power of 3,025 MW. Water enters the reactor at 542.6°P and flows through the reactor at a rate of 136.3 x 106 lb/hr. The system pressure is 2,250 psia.3 At what temperature does the coolant leave the reactor? 2Data for correcting saturation values of h for higher pressure are given in Table 4 of J. H. Keenan and F. G. Keyes, Thermodynamic Properties of Steam Including Data for the Liquid and Solid Phases, New York: Wiley, 1959. In the temperature region from 400°F to 600°F and up to pressures of 300 psi, the correction for h amounts to less than 1 %. 3Psia means absolute pressure in Ib/in2 The difference between the reactor pressure and at­ mospheric pressure is called gauge pressure and is abbreviated psig.

The enthalpy ofthe emerging water is then hout = 539.7 + 75.7 = 615.4 Btu/lb. A second interpolation from Table IV.l shows that this corresponds to water at a temperature of 599.1 OF. [Ans.] Example 8.2 A BWR operating at pressure of 6.895 MPa produces 2.93 x 106 kg of steam per hour. Feed water enters the reactor at 190.6°C. (a) What is the temperature of the steam? (b) At what power is the reactor operating? Solution. 1. The steam emerges at essentially the temperature at which the water boiled. According to Table IV.2, at a pressure of 6.895 MPa, this is 284.86°C. [Ans.] 2. From Table IV.2, h of the steam is 2,773.2 kJ/kg, while from Table IV.l, at 190.6°C, h of the feed water is 807.8 kJ/kg. Then Eq. (8.4) gives q = 2.93 x 106(2,773.2 -807.8) = 5,758 x 106 JIhr = 1,599 MW. [Ans.] 8.2 HEAT GENERATION IN REACTORS The starting point in the design of a reactor cooling system is the determination of the spatial distribution of the heat produced within the reactor. This problem is discussed in this section. It was pointed out in Chapter 3 that the energy released in fission appears in several fOnTIs-as kinetic energy of the fission neutrons, as prompt fission y-rays, as y-rays and f3-rays from the decay of fission products, and in the emission of neu� trinos. With the exception of the neutrinos, virtually all of this energy is ultimately absorbed somewhere in the reactor. However, because these various radiations are attenuated in different ways by matter, their energy tends to be deposited in differ­ ent locations. In the following discussion of the deposition of energy, it is assumed

page number: 427
 text: Sec. 8.2 Heat Generation in Reactors 409 that the reactor fuel is in the form of individual fuel rods. This is the case for virtu­ ally all power reactor concepts except the molten salt breeder reactor (see Section 4.5). Heat Production in Fuel Elements (Fuel Rods) As indicated in Table 3.6, the fission fragments have a kinetic energy of about 168 Me V per fission. These highly charged particles have an extremely short range (see Section 3.9), and therefore their energy is deposited near the site of the fis­ sion within the fuel. Similarly, most of the 8 MeV of the fission product fJ-rays is also deposited in the fuel. However, many of the y-rays from the decaying fission products and those emitted directly in fission pass out of the fuel since they are less strongly attenuated than charged particles. Some of these y-rays are absorbed in the surrounding coolant and/or moderator, in the thermal shield, or in the radi­ ation shielding that surrounds the reactor. However, because of the proximity of fuel rods in most reactors, many of the y-rays are intercepted by and absorbed in neighboring rods. The prompt neutrons are emitted with a total kinetic energy of about 5 Me V per fission. In a thermal reactor, the bulk of this energy is deposited in the moder­ ator as the neutrons slow down. The capture y-rays emitted following the absorp­ tion of these neutrons in nonfission reactions are therefore produced and absorbed throughout the reactor. In a fast reactor, the fission neutrons slow down very little before they are absorbed, and their kinetic energy appears as an addition to the energy of the capture y-rays. The delayed neutrons contribute negligibly to the en­ ergy of a reactor. As already noted, none of the energy of the neutrinos is retained within a reactor. It should be clear from the foregoing remarks that the spatial deposition of fission energy depends on the details of the reactor's structure. Nevertheless, for preliminary calculations, it may be assumed that approximately one-third of the total y-ray energy-about 5 MeV-is absorbed in the fuel. This, together with the 168 MeV from the fission fragments and 8 MeV from the fJ-rays, gives 181 MeV per fission (about 90% of the recoverable fission energy), which is deposited in the fuel, most in the immediate vicinity of the fission site. The remainder (about 20 Me V) of the recoverable energy is deposited in the coolant and/or moderator, in various structural materials, and in the blanket, reflector, and shield. The rate at which fission occurs in the fuel, and hence the rate of production of heat, varies from fuel rod to fuel rod, and it is also a function of position within any given rod. In particular, if Ed is the energy deposited locally in the fuel per fission, then the rate of heat production per unit volume at the point r is given by

The natural units of q'" are Me V Isec-cm3 However, for engineering calculations, q'" should be converted to units of Btulhr-ft 3 or kW/lit using the conversion factors in Appendix I. In the thennal reactor, most of the fissions are induced by thennal neutrons. In this case, according to the results of Section 5.9, the integral in Eq. (8.6) can be written as (8.7) where "E fr is the thennal fission cross-section of the fuel and ¢T (r) is the thennal flux. In the framework of a multi group calculation, Eq. (8.6) can also be expressed in the fonn q'" (r) = Ed L "E fg¢g(r), g (8.8) where the sum is carried out over all the groups and the notation is the same as in Section 5.8. The spatial dependence of the flux depends on the geometry and structure of the reactor. However, many heat removal calculations are carried out for the theoretical case of the bare, finite cylinder. For a thennal reactor, the thennal flux is then (see Table 6.2) (8.9) where P is the total power of the reactor in joules, E R is the recoverable energy per fission in joules, V is the reactor volume in cm3, and Ii and ii are its outer dimensions in centimeters to the extrapolated boundaries. In obtaining Eq. (8.9), it was assumed that the fuel is homogeneously distributed throughout the reactor, 4The following notation for heat production and flow is well established in heat transfer liter- ature and is used in this chapter: q'" power density, rate of energy production per unit volume; BTUlhr-ft 3 or kWllit, q" heat flux; BTUIhr-ft 2 or W/cm2, q' linear power; Btulhr-ft or kW/m, q: heat transfer rate; Btulhr or MW.

For instance, suppose that there are n fuel rods of radius a and length H, the height of the core. Then if L fr is the macroscopic fission cross-section of the rod, the total fission cross-section in the entire cores is L fr X nJr a2 H. Therefore, the average value of L f in the core is and the flux is -2 -2 -L frnJra H L frna L f = Jr R2 H = R2 _ 3.63P R2 (2.405r) (JrZ) ¢T (r, z) - 10 -_ -cos -;:::: ERLfr Va2n R H - 10 _ cos _ , _ 1.16P (2.405r) (JrZ) ERLfrHa2n R H where V = Jr R2 H has been substituted. (8.10) (8.11) When the expression for ¢T in Eq. (8.11) is introduced into Eq.

The dependence of q'" on r in Eq. (8.12) gives the change in the flux from rod to rod across the diameter of the core-not across any individual fuel rod. Indeed, given the derivation ofEq. (8.12), q'" must be taken to be constant across individual rods. This does not introduce significa nt errors in heat transfer calculations, especially for the small-diameter, weakly absorbing (low-enrichment) fuel rods currently used in most power reac­ tors. From Eq. (8.12), it is evident that the maximum rate of heat production occurs in the middle (z = 0) of the central rod (R = 0). In this case, both functions in Eq. (8.12) are unity, and the maximum value of q'" is 1/1 1.16PEd qrnax = Ha2nER· 5 Recall that macroscopic cross-section is cross-section per unit volume. (8.13)

In particular, Eq. (8.13) considerably overestimates the value of q:ax for a reflected and/or nonuniformly fueled reactor, which has a smaller maximum-to-a verage flux ratio than a bare reactor (see Section 6.3). To see this effect, it is first noted that (8.16) where <Pmax is the maximum value of the thermal flux. The total reactor power is given by (8.17) where <Pav is the average thermal flux and � f is again the macroscopic fission cross-section averaged over the entire core volume V Dividing Eq.

Solution. 1. There are n = 193 x 204 = 39,372 rods in the reactor. Assuming that Ed = 180 MeV and ER = 200 MeV, Eq.

To obtain similar results for a rod located at r = 20 in, it is merely necessary to multiply the prior answers by the factor appearing in Eqs.

[Ans.] Chap. 8 As noted already, roughly 10% of the recoverable energy of fission is absorbed outside the fuel. In thermal reactors, the kinetic energy of the fission neutrons is deposited in the surrounding moderator and coolant in more or less the same spatial distribution as the fissions from which these neutrons originate. However, only 2% to 3% of the fission energy appears in this form, and it is often assumed that this kinetic energy is deposited uniformly throughout the core. The calculation of the energy deposition from the longer range y-rays is a more difficult problem. In principle, this can be determined by evaluating the integral (8.20) where ¢y (r, Ey) is the y-ray flux as a function of position and energy, and /La (Ey) is the linear absorption coefficient. The computation ¢y(r,Ey) is complica ted by the fact that y-rays undergo multiple Compton scattering-a problem discussed in Chapter 10. However, in source-free regions outside the core, such as the thermal shield or reactor vessel, the y-ray flux may be presumed to fall off approximately exponentially, provided the region in question is not too many mean-free paths thick. In this case, q"'Cr) = f _e-,,"(Ey)' <pyoCEy)Eyf.laCEy)dEy. (8.21) Here, ¢yo(Ey) is the y-ray flux as a function of energy incident on the region. Equation (8.21) is usually evaluated by dividing the y-ray spectrum into a number of energy groups. This procedure is illustrated in Section 10.11. Fission Product Decay Heating After a few days of reactor operati on, the f3-and y-radiation emitted from decaying fission products amounts to about 7% of the total thermal power output of the reactor. When the reactor is shut down, the accumulated fission products continue to decay and release energy within the reactor. This fission product decay energy can be quite sizable in absolute terms, and a means for cooling the reactor core after shutdown must be provided in all reactors except those operating at very low

 text: Sec. 8.2 Heat Generation in Reactors 415 power levels. If this is not done, the temperature of the fuel may rise to a point where the integrity of the fuel is compromised and fission products are released. Consider a reactor that has been operating at a constant thermal power Po long enough for the concentrations of the radioactive fission products to come to equilibrium. Since the rate of production of the fission products is proportional to the reactor power, it follows that the activity of the fission products at any time af­ ter the reactor has been shut down is also proportional to Po. The ratio P (ts) / Po, where P (ts) is the power (rate of energy release) emanating from the fission prod­ ucts at the time ts after shutdown, is therefore independent of Po. Figure 8.3 shows this ratio as a function of ts, in seconds, for a 235U-fueled thermal reactor. The figure is based on a recoverable energy per fission of 200 MeV. Figure 8.3 can also be used to give values of the fission product decay power for a reactor that is operated for the finite time to and then shut down. The ratio P (to, ts) / Po, where ts is again the cooling time (reactor off), is then obtained from the expression ---- - ----Po Po The two terms on the right of this equation are to be found from Fig. 8.3.

In this problem, Po = 825 MW and to = 1.5 years = 1.5 x 3.16 x 107 sec. Then at shutdown, ts = 10-1 sec (the shortest time in Fig. 8.3), and from Eq.

(8.24) in a straightforward way, the results are: at shutdown, 1.84 MW; after 1 hour, � 1.84 MW; after 1 year, � zero. [Ans.] 8.3 HEAT FLOW BY CONDUCTION Energy is removed from a reactor by two fundamentally different heat transfer processes -conduction and convection. In conduction, heat is transmitted from one location in a body to another as a result of a temperature difference existing in the body-there is no macroscopic movement of any portion of the body. It is by this mechanism, as shown in this section, that heat produced in a fuel rod is transferred to the surface of the rod. Heat convection involves the transfer of heat to a moving liquid or gas, again as the result of a temperature difference and the later rejection of this heat at another location. Thus, the heat conducted to the surface of a fuel rod is carried into the coolant and out of the system by convection. Such convective heat transfer is discussed in Section 8.4. For completene ss, it should be mentioned that heat can also be transferred as thermal radiation across a vacuum or other rarefied space between a hotter body and a colder one. However, this process is of relatively little importance except in some gas-cooled reactors and is not considered further. The �quations of Weat Conduction The fundamental relationship governing heat conduction is Fourier's law, which for an isotropic medium is written as q" = -k grad T. (8.25)

 text: 418 Heat Removal from Nuclear Reactors Chap. 8 Here q", which is called the heat flux, is defined so that q" n is equal to the rate of heat flow across a unit area with unit outward nonnal n. Thus, q" is entirely analogous to the neutron current density vector defined in Chapter 5. In the English system, q" has units of Btulhr-ft2 and W/m2 in SI units. The parameter k in Eq. (8.25) is called the thermal conductivity and has units of Btu/hr-ft-oF in the English system and W/m-K in SI units. Values of k for a number of important substances are given in Appendix IV. In general, k is a function of temperature. The function Tin Eq. (8.25) is the temperature in of or K as appropriate. The similarity between Eq. (8.25) and Fick's law of diffusion should be especially noted. Consider an arbitrary volume V of material throughout a portion of which heat is being produced. From the conservation of energy, the net rate at which heat flows out of the surface of V in the steady state, must be equal to the total rate at which heat is produced within V If this were not the case, the substance would change temperature and therefore would not be in a steady state. In equation form, [Net rate of flOW] _ [rate of heat production] = 0 of heat out of V within V . The net rate at which heat flows out of the surface of V is Heat flow = i q" n dA, (8.26) (8.27) where the vector q" is as defined earlier, n is a unit vector nonnal to the surface, and the integral is taken over the entire surface. From the divergence theorem, Eq. (8.27) can also .be written as Heat flow = Iv div q"dV, (8.28) The total rate of heat production within V is equal to Heat production = Iv q'" d V, (8.29) where q'" is the rate at which heat is produced per unit volume. Equations (8.28) and (8.29) can now be introduced into Eq. (8.26). Since the integrals are over the same arbitrarily selected volumes, their integrands must be equal and the following expression is obtain�d: div q" -q'" = O. (8.30) This result is the steady-state equation of conductivity for heat transf�r and is analo .. gous to the equation of continuity (Eq. 5.15) discussed in Section 5.3 in connection with neutron diffusion. There is no tenn in Eq. (8.30) equivalent to the absorption

(8.25), is substituted into Eq. (8.30) and the resulting equation is divided through by k, which is assumed to be constant, the result is (8.31) This is called the steady-state heat conduction equation and is of a fonn known as Poisson's equation. In a region where there are no heat sources, q'" = 0 and Eq. (8.31) reduces to (8.32) which is called Laplace's equation. These results are now applied to some problems of interest in nuclear reactors. One of the central problems, as is seen, is the calculation of the heat that can be transferred out of a fuel rod and ultimately into a coolant for a given maximum temperature in the fuel. The maximum fuel temperature is a preset condition that must not be exceeded for reasons of safety. Plate-Type Fuel Elements Consider first a plate-type fuel element or rod like that shown in Fig. 8.4, consisting of a fueled central strip (the "meat") of thickness 2a surrounded on all sides by cladding of thickness h. It is assumed that heat is generated unifonnly within the fuel at the rate of q'If Btulhr-ft3 or kWllit, and that the temperature has reached a steady-state distribution throughout the element. Ordinarily, the total thickness of such an element is small compared with either its width or length. It is reasonable to ignore the negligible amount of heat flowing out through the edges or ends of the element. In short, the heat flows only in the x direction, where x is the distance from the center of the element nonnal to the surface (see Fig. 8.4). The temperature distribution in the fuel is then detennined Figure 8.4 A plate-type fuel element.

 text: 420 Heat Removal from Nuclear Reactors Chap. 8 by Poisson's equation in one dimension, d2T q'" dx2 + kj = 0, (8.33) where k j is the thermal conductivity of the fuel. Two boundary conditions must be specified with a second-order differential equation like Eq. (8.33). In the present problem, these are (i) T(O) = Tm, where Tm is the maximum (central temperature) in the fuel, and .. dT (n) -= 0 dx at x = O. The second condition follows from the symmetry of the problem, which permits no heat flow at the center of the fuel. Integrating Eq. (8.33) twice gives the general solution q'" T = -k x2 = C1x + C2, 2 j where C 1 and C2 are constants. Placing x = 0 immediately gives C2 = Tm. Also, in view of condition (ii), C 1 must be taken to be zero. The temperature within the fuel is therefore q'" T = T. -_x2 m 2kj (8.34) Using this equation, the temperature Ts at the surface of the fuel (at the fuel­ cladding interface) may be evaluated. Thus, writing x = a in Eq. (8.34) gives q"'a2 Ts = Tm -2kj . (8.35) The total rate of heat production in the fuel is equal to q'" multiplied by the fuel volume 2Aa, where A is the area t)f t)ne face of the fuel. In the steady state, all of the heat produced within the fuel flows out of the fuel. The heat flowing through one face of the fuel is therefore q=q"'Aa. (8.36) This result can also be obtained from Eq. (8.34) using Fourier's law. Thus, the heat flux (heat flow per unit area) is given by "-k dT q -j dx'

 text: Sec. 8.3 Heat Flow by Conduction 421 where the derivative is to be evaluated at x = a. Inserting Eq. (8.34) and perform­ ing the differentiation yields II '" q = q a. The total rate of heat flowing out of one side of the fuel is then q = q"A = q"'Aa, which is the same as Eq. (8.36). It is sometimes convenient to rewrite Eq. (8.36) in a form in which q'" has been eliminated through Eq. (8.35). Thus, solving Eq. (8.35) for q'" and inserting the result into Eq. (8.36) gives Tm -T.� q--a/2kfA· (8.37) This expression may be viewed as the heat transfer analogue of Ohm's law in electricity-namely, V 1=­R' (8.38) where I is the current, V is the potential difference, and R is the resistance. In the present case, q corresponds to I, Tm -Ts is analogous to the potential difference, and a/2k f A is called the thermal resistance. The value of this analogy is clear shortly. Turning next to the temperature distribution in the cladding of the plate-type fuel element shown in Fig. 8.4, it is first observed that, since there is little or no heat generated in this region, q'" = 0 and the heat conduction equation reduces to d2T dx2 = o. (8.39) This is the simplest form of Laplace's equation (Eq. 8.32). The boundary conditions are now (i) T(a) = Ts (ii) T(a + b) = Tc, where Tc is the temperature at the outer surface of the cladding. Integrating Eq. (8.39) twice gives T = C1x + C2. The constants C 1 and C2 are easily found from conditions (i) and (ii), and the final expression for T is

page number: 440
 text: 422 Heat Removal from Nuclear Re actors Chap. 8 (8.40) It should be observed that T is a linear function of position in the source-free cladding, whereas it is quadratic in the region containing fuel. The temperature distribution in the fuel element is as shown in Fig. 8.5. Since there are no sources or sinks for heat within the cladding, all of the heat passing into the cladding from the fuel is conducted to the outer surface of the cladding. This rate of heat flow can be found by multiplying the heat flux, which is obtained by applying Fourier's law to Eq. (8.40), by the area of the element. This gives (8.41) where kc is the conductivity of the cladding. If Eq. (8.41) i� put in the fonn and Eq. (8.37) is rewritten as (Tm -T,) = q (2k:A) , the temperature Ts, which is not a conveniently measured parameter, can be elimi­ nated by adding the last two equations. The result is Fuel I I I I I I yCladding I I I a a+b x Figure 8.S Temperature distribution across plate-type fyel element.

In the electrical analogue, T m -Tc is the difference in potential and a b R= --+ -2kfA kcA is the total thermal resistance of the fuel and cladding. (8.43) Equation (8.43) shows that, when heat passes through a succession of two materials, the situation is analogous to an electrical potential across two resistances connected in series, where the total resistance is the sum of the two. This conclusion is readily generalized to a sequence of any number of materials-the total thermal resistance is the sum of the resistances of each material. In the derivation of Eq. (8.42), it is assumed implicitly that the fuel and cladding are tightly bonded together at their point of contact. Some fuel elements, however, have a thin region of bonding material between the fuel and cladding, whereas others have a narrow region of gas between the two. The total thermal resistance is larger in this case and is obtained by adding an appropriate resistance term to Eq. (8.43). The temperature difference Tm -Tc must then be greater for a given heat flow out of the surface of the fuel element. Cylindrical Fuel Rod Consider a long cylind rical fuel rod of radius a surrounded by cladding of thickness b. It is assumed again that heat is produced at the constant rate q'" within the rod and that there is no heat released in the cladding. The temperature in the rod is only a function of the distance r from the axis of the rod, so that in cylindrical coordinates the heat conduction equation is d2T 1 dT q'" -+--+-=0. dr2 r dr kf The boundary conditions appropriate to this problem are (i) T is nonsingula r within the rod, (ii) T(O) = Tm, where Tm is the central temperature of the fuel.

(8.44) is q"'r2 T=- --+C1lnr+C2, 4kf where C1 and C2 are constants to be determined. In view of the boundary condi­ tions, it is evident that C 1 = 0 and C2 = T m' Thus, the temperature within the rod is q'''r2 T = T. - --. m 4kf (8.45) The rate at which heat is produced within the rod, and therefore the rate at which it flows out of the rod, is equal to q = rra2 H q'" (8.46) where H is the length of the rod (approximately equal to the height of the core). Solving for q'" and introducing this into Eq. (8.45), evaluated at r = a where the temperature is Ts, then gives Tm - Ts q = 1/(4rr Hkf)' In view of Eq.

(8.49) yields 2n Hkc(Ts -Tc) q= InO + b/a) The thermal resistance of the cladding is therefore InO + b/a) Rc = . 2n Hkc Frequently, b is much less than a. In this case, since Eq. (8.51) can be written as b Rc�---2naHkc 425 (8.50) (8.51) (8.52) In terms of the overall temperature difference between the center of the fuel and the surface of the cladding, the heat flowing out of the rod is Tm -Tc q = Rj + Rc' (8.53) where R j is given by Eq. (8.48) and Rc is given by Eq. (8.51) or (8.52). This result may be verified by solving Eq. (8.47) for Tm -Ts and Eq. (8.50) for Ts -Tc and adding the two expressions. Space-Dependent Heat Sources In both of the foregoing calculations of the temperature distribution and heat flow in plate-type and cylindrical fuel rods, it is assumed that the heat is produced at the constant rate q'" throughout the fueled portion of the rod. Accordingly, the temperature does not vary along the length of the rod, and it is possible to relate the total heat flow out of the entire rod to the difference in temperature between the center and surface of the rod. However, it is shown in Section 8.2 that q'" does, in fact, vary approximately as (see Eqs. [8.12] and [8.13])

 text: 426 Heat Removal from Nuclear Reactors Chap. 8 '" 1/1 (1TZ) q = qrnax cos ii (8.54) where Z is measured from the midpoint of the rod. There is negligible variation in q'" in the x and y directions of the plate-type element or in the radial direction of a cylindrical rod. A nonuniform heat distribution like that given in Eq. (8.54) would be expected to give rise to a nonuniform temperature distribution along the length of a fuel rod-and, indeed, to some extent this is the case. In a power reac­ tor, however, the coolant passes along the fuel rods at a temperature considerably lower than the temperature of the fuel, and the temperature gradient is therefore much steeper across the diameter of the fuel than along the length of the rod. As a consequence, most of the heat generated in the fuel flows directly to the surface of the rod; there is little or no heat flow in the z direction. It is possible to generalize the calculations made in this section to the case where q'" is a function of z. This can be done by dividing the calculated value of q, which is the the total heat flow out of the surface of a fuel rod, by the surface area of the rod. This gives the heat flux, q", which is independent of position if q'" is constant, but varies with position if q'" is not. For instance, if Eq. (8.46) is divided by 21T (a + b) H, the area of a clad fuel rod, the result is 2 "( ) a "'( ) q Z = 2(a + b) q z. (8.55) This is the heat flux at the surface of the rod as a function of z. Similarly, q" (z) can be found as a function of the temperature difference Tm To where both temperatures may be functions of z, by dividing Eq. (8.53) by 21T(a + b)H: Example 8.5 "( ) Tm (z) -Tc(z) q z = 21T(a + b)H(Rf + Rc) (8.56) The fuel rods for the reactor described in Example 8.3 consist of a fueled portion 0.42 in. in diameter that is clad with Zircaloy-4, 0.024 in thick. Each rod is 12 ft long. Given that the center temperature of the fuel is 3,970 OF at the midpoint of the central rod, calculate at this point the (a) heat flux out of the rod; (b) outer temperature of the cladding. Solution. 1. From Example 8.3, q'" at the midpoint of the central rod is 4.66 x 107 BTU/hr­ ft3 The radius of the fuel is 0.21/12 = 0.0175 ft, whereas the cladding thick­ ness is 0.024/12 = 0.002 ft.

It is also used to compute the thennal stresses that accompany such nonunifonn temperature distributi ons. As is shown in the problems at the end of the chapter, under certain conditions the temperature in the slab may rise to a maximum value that is larger than either TI or T2. 8.4 HEAT TRANSFER TO COOLANTS As noted earlier, the heat produced in the fuel or deposited by radiation in other parts of a reactor is transferred to a coolant of one type or another, which, in turn, carries the heat outside the system. The fundamental relation describing the transfer of heat from a heated solid to a moving fluid (liquid or gas) is Newton's law of cooling: (8.60) In this expression, q" is the heat flux in Btulhr-ft2-0P, Tc is the temperature of the surface of the solid (in the case of reactor fuel, this is the outer temperature of the cladding), and Tb is an appropriate reference temperature of the fluid.

page number: 447
 text: Sec. 8.4 Heat Transfer to Coolants 429 The numerical value of the heat transfer coefficient depends on many factors, including the nature of the coolant, the manner in which it flows by the heated surface, and the coolant temperature. Methods for calculating h from experimental data are presented later in this chapter. At this point, however, it is of interest to note the range of values of h that are applicable to the coolants in power reactors. For ordinary and heavy water, h usually lies between 5,000 and 8,000 Btulhr-ft2-0F (25 and 45 kW/m2 K); for gases, h ranges between about 10 and 100 Btulhr-ft2-OF (55 and 550 W/m2 K); and for liquid sodium, h is generally between 4,000 and 50,000 Btulhr-ft 2_oF (20 and 300 kW/m2 K). In most reactor heat transfer problems, the fluid flows along the fuel in well­ defined coolant channels. Since the temperature of the fluid ordinarily varies with position across each channel, it is possible to define the temperature Tb in Eq. (8.60) in any number of ways. In most heat transfer calculations, Tb is taken to be the mixed mean or bulk temperature of the fluid. This is defined by the fonnula f pcpvTdAc Tb = , f pCpvdAc (8.61) where p is the fluid density, C p is its specific heat, v is the fluid velocity, T is the temperature , d Ac is the differential of channel area, and the integrations are carried out over the cross-section of the channel. In general, each of the variables in the integrals may be a function of position across the channel. The temperature Tb defined by Eq. (8.61) is the temperature the fluid would achieve if it were allowed to mix adiabatically-for instance, if the fluid flowing out of the channel were collected and mixed in an insulated container. Measured values of hare nonnally given in tenns of the bulk temperature of the fluid. The total rate of heat flow across an area A between a solid and a fluid is q = q" A = h A (Tc -Tb). Written in the fonn of Ohm's law, Eq. (8.62) is Tc -Tb q = 1/ ha . (8.62) (8.63) The denomina tor in this equation is the thennal resistance for convective heat trans­ fer, 1 Rh=-· hA (8.64) It is now possible to return to the fuel element problems considered in the last section and compute the rate at which heat is transferred to a coolant, for a given difference in temperature between the center of the fuel and the fluid. For

(8.43) and (8.64): a b 1 R = 2k fA + kcA + hA' and the total heat flow through one side of the fuel element to the fluid is Tm -Tb q = -a---b---l-· 2kfA + keA + hA (8.65) (8.66) Similarly, from Eqs. (8.48) and (8.51), the total thermal resistance for a clad cylin­ drical fuel rod is 1 In(l + bla) 1 R= + +-, 477: Hkf 277: Hke hA where A = 277:(a + b)H. If b «a, 1 b 1 R= + +-. 477: Hkf 277:aHke hA In either case, the rate of heat flow into the coolant is Tm - Tb q= R (8.67) (8.68) (8.69) These results, which apply to the case of uniform heat production along the length of the fuel, can be generalized to the more realistic situation where q'" de­ pends on z. Thus, as explained in the preceding section, most of the heat produced in the fuel flows directly to the coolant in a direction normal to the axis of the fuel rod. The expression for the heat flux, obtained by dividing q in Eq. (8.69) by the surface area of the rod, is therefore valid at every point along the rod. Thus, for the cylindrical rod, it follows that "() Tm (z) - Tb(z) q Z = . 277:(a + b)H R In terms of Te, the outer temperature of the cladding, "( ) Te(z) - Tb(z) q z = 277:(a + b)H Rh = h[Te(z) -Tb(z)], which is simply Newton's law, Eq.

 text: Sec. 8.4 Heat Transfer to Coolants 431 Example 8.6 The fuel rods in Examples 8.3 and 8.5 are cooled with pressurized water. Given that the heat transfer coefficient is 7,500 Btulhr-ft2_OF, calculate the bulk temperature of the water opposite the midpoint of the hottest rod. Solution. According to Example 8.5, at the point in question, q" = 3.66 X 105 Btulhr-ft2 and Tc = 650°F. From Eq. (8.60), Tb = 650 -3.66 x 105/7,500 = 601°F. [Ans.] For reasons discussed later, this is not the highest temperature of the coolant, al­ though q'" is greatest at this point. Temperature along a Coolant Channel As the coolant moves along the fuel, it absorbs heat; as a result, its temperature continually increases. However, the temperature does not increase at a constant rate since the heat is released from the fuel nonuniformly-according to q'" = q:ax cos ( :; ) (8.71) This equation applies !9 the central (r = 0) rod; for other rods, q'" must be mul­ tiplied by Jo(2.405r / R). A simple method is now discussed for estimating the variation in the temperature of the coolant and the fuel as a function of z, when the heat is produced in the fuel according to Eq. (8.71). Before proceeding, it should be noted that, except for the fuel rods at the edge of the core, there is only one coolant channel associated with each fuel rod. This may be taken to be either the volume between neighboring fuel rods, with a portion of each rod contributing heat to the channel, or the volume of coolant in a unit cell surrounding one rod. As shown in Fig. 8.7 for a square array of rods, the volumes of coolant associated with the surface area of one rod are the same in both cases. Consider a coolant slab of thickness dz as it moves along a coolant channel. The volume of this slab is equal to Acdz, where Ac is the cross-sectional area of the channel, and its mass is pAcdz, where p is the coolant density. As the slab progresses up the channel the distance dz, it absorbs heat from the fuel, which raises the temperature of the slab the amount dTb.6 The heat required to produce the change dTb is equal to 6Throughout this discussion, the coolant is assumed not to boil. If it is boiling, then the ab­ sorption of heat goes into vaporization of the coolant at constant temperature.

The rate at which heat is added to the flowing coolant is obtained by dividing this quantity by the time dt required for the coolant to move the distance dz. Thus, dz dq = pAc-cpdTb = pAcvcpdTb, dt where v is the velocity of the fluid. However, pA -cv is equal to the rate of flow of the coolant through the channel, w, and so (8.72) As noted earlier, most of the heat produced in the fuel flows directly into the coolant and not along the interior of the fuel. Therefore, the heat dq in Eq. (8.72) is generated in a fuel volume of A Idz, where A I is the cross-sectional area of the fuel portion of a fuel rod. Thus, wCpdTb = q'" A Idz. Introducing the function q'" from Eq. (8.71) and integrating from the point of entry of the coolant at z = -H /2, where its temperature is Tbo, to an arbitrary point z along the channel gives q:ax VI [ .

 text: -HI2 Sec. 8.4 Heat Transfer to Coolants 433 Equation (8.73) gives the temperature of the coolant as a function of position along the central or hottest channel. The temperature along other channels can be obtained by multiplying the second term in Eq. (8.73) by the factor Jo(2.405r / R). According to Eq. (8.73), the coolant temperature increases along the channel and reaches a maximum value (8.74) at the exit of the channel. This behavior of Tb is illustrated in Fig. 8.8. The tem­ perature of the fluid leaving channels other than the central, hottest channel is also highest at the exit, but necessarily lower than the temperature of the coolant leaving the hottest channel. The temperature Tc of the surface of the cladding can now be found as a function of position along the channel by observing that the heat transferred from a length dz of the fuel rod to the coolant is hCcdz (Tc -Tb), where Cc is the cir­ cumference of the clad rod. This is equal to the heat generated in the length d z of the fuel-namely, q:axA fdz cos(rrz/ H). It follows that hCc(Tc -Tb) = q:axA f cos (';;) Inserting Tb from Eq.

 text: 434 Heat Removal from Nuclear Reactors Chap. 8 This may also be written as (8.75) where Rh is the resistance for convective heat transfer (see Eq. [8.64]). The temperature T m along the center of the fuel can also be calculated from Eq. (8.73). It is assumed that all of the heat produced in a slab of fuel of thickness dz flows directly into the coolant. This rate of heat flow is equal to the temperature difference Tm -Tb divided by the total thermal resistance of a section of fuel and coolant dz thick. The resistance of such a section is simply the resistance calculated earlier for the full length of the fuel multiplied by the ratio dz/ H. Equating heat production and heat flux then gives Tm -Tb If! (nz) H = q max A f cos ii ' where R is given by Eq. (8.65) for plate-type fuel elements and by Eq. (8.67) or Eq. (8.68) for cylindrical fuel rods. Solving for Tm and introducing Tb from Eq. (8.73) yields finally (8.76) A plot of Eqs. (8.75) and (8.76) is given in Fig. 8.8. It is evident from the figure that both Tc and Tm rise along the channel and reach maximum values in the upper part of the channel beyond the midpoint of the fuel. There are two reasons that the maximum temperature of the fuel occurs there, rather than at midchannel, where q'" is the greatest. First, the temperature of the coolant continues to increase past the midpoint. Second, the heat flux q" is determined only by the value of q"', and this, being a cosine function, decreases very slowly in the vicinity of z = o. But q", in tum, specifies the temperature difference Tm -Tb. Therefore, with Tb increasing, Tm must also increase to provide the actual value of q" Further along the channel, q" begins to drop more rapidly, and Tm eventually decreases. It is this combined effect of a rising Tb and a decreasing q" that gives rise to and determines the position of the maximum fuel (and cladding) temperature. To find the locations of these maximum temperature s, the derivatives of Tc or Tm are placed equal to zero. When this is done with Eq. (8.75), the result is easily found to be (8.77)

Furthermore, the results are not applicable to liquid metal coolants, where there may be appreciable heat conduction in the Z direction. The derivations also do not apply to coolants that are undergoing bulk boiling, although they are valid for locally boiling coolants.

(8.64) and Example 8.6, the total convective resistance is Rh = 1/7,500 x 2rr(0.0175 + 0.002) x 12 = 9.07 x 10-5°F-hrIBtu. The location of the maximum cladding temperature is then given by Eq. (8.77): 12 -1 -5 Zc max = -cot (rr x 3148 x 1.3 x 9.07 X 10 ) , rr 12 = -coel (1.17) = 2.71 ft. rr Thus, the maximum value of Tc occurs 2.71 ft beyond the midpoint of the channel. The value of ex in Eq. (8.80) is 1.17 and from Eq.

Then using Eqs. (8.78), (8.81), and (8.82), f3 = 80.5, Zm,max = 0.047 ft (so that the temperature of the fuel is greatest at just about the midpoint of the fuel), and Tm,max = 3,940°F. [Ans.] The Heat Transfer Coefficient -Nonmetallic Coolants The extent to which heat is transferred to a moving fluid, and hence the value of the heat transfer coefficient, depends on the details of the internal motions of the fluid as it flows along a coolant channel. If every portion of the fluid moves parallel to the walls of the channel, then the heat travels radially into the fluid largely by conduction. The flow, in this case, is said to be laminar. In contrast, if there are significant radial components of velocity fluctuations within the fluid, the heat is picked up at the wall by portions of the fluid and carried directly into the interior of the channel. This is the description of turbulent flow. Clearly, other things being equal, heat is more readily transferred to a fluid undergoing turbulent flow than laminar flow. As a general rule, in those reactors in which the coolant is pumped through the system (as opposed to reactors cooled by natural convection), the coolant flows under turbulent conditions.

 text: Sec. 8.4 Heat Transfer to Coolants Distance into channel I Center line J of channel 437 Figure 8.9 Temperature distributions in a nonmetallic coolant and in a liquid metal coolant undergoing turbulent flow. One of the consequences of the internal motions of the coolant undergoing turbulent flow is that the temperature distribution tends to be more or less uniform over much of the interior region of a coolant channel. Thus, as shown in Fig. 8.9, the temperature drops rapidly with distance in the vicinity of the fuel and quickly reaches the bulk temperature of the fluid. This is in marked contrast to the situation in conduction, where the temperature changes more uniformly with position. Even under turbulent conditions, however, some heat is always transferred to the interior of a coolant by conduction, but for the nonmetallic coolants this contribution is negligibly small. With ordinary water, for example, less than 1 % of the heat transfer occurs by conduction when the water is undergoing turbulent flow. It is possible to characterize the flow of a fluid in terms of a dimensionless parameter known as the Reynolds number, which is defined as Devp Re= --, fJ-(8.83) where De is the equivalent diameter of the coolant channel discussed later, v is the average velocity of the fluid, p is its density, and fJ-is the fluid viscosity. The value of De is to be computed from the formula cross-sectional area of coolant channel De = 4 X --------------­wetted perimeter of coolant channel (8.84) The term wetted perimeter in this expression refers to that portion of the perimeter of the channel that is structural and that therefore creates drag to passing coolant. For a hollow pipe carrying a coolant, the wetted perimeter is simply the interior perimeter of a section of the pipe perpendicular to its axis. Thus, with a circular pipe of inside radius a, the numerator in Eq. (8.84) is na2 and the denomina tor is 2na, so that De = 2a, the actual pipe diameter. For a bundle of rods of radius a in a square array of pitch s, as shown in Fig. 8.7, the cross-sectional area of a single

page number: 456
 text: 438 Heat Removal from Nuclear Reactors Chap. 8 coolant channel is equal to s2 -na2, the wetted perimeter is 2na, and Eq. (8.84) gives S2 -na2 De =2 X ----na (8.85) It has been found experimentally that the flow of most fluids is laminar up to a value of the Reynolds number of about 2,000. Between 2,000 and 10,000, the flow is partly laminar and partly turbulent, the fraction of each depending on the structural details of the coolant channel, the roughness of the channel walls, and other factors. Above Re = 10,000, a fluid moves in fully developed turbulent flow. In summary, a high value of the Reynolds number implies a large amount of turbulence, a high value of the heat transfer coefficient, and a high rate of heat flow into the coolant for a given difference in temperature between the cladding and the coolant. Example 8.8 The fuel rods described in Example 8.5 are placed in a square array with a pitch of 0.600 in. The rods are cooled by pressurized water (P = 2,000 psi), which is flowing at a speed of 15.6 ftlsec. Calculate the Reynolds number for this coolant flow assuming the water temperature is 600°F. Solution. The radius of the fuel rods is 0.210 + 0.024 = 0.234 in. From Eq. (8.85), the equivalent diameter is (0.6)2 -Tr(0.234)2 . De = 2 X = 0.512 III = 0.0427 ft. Tr X 0.234 The flow velocity is 15.6 X 3,600 = 56,200 ftlhr. From Table IV.3, at 6000P and 2,000 psi, p = 42.9 Ib/ft3 and J.l = 0.212 lb/hr-ft. Then substituting into Eg. (8.83) gives 0.0427 x 56,200 x 42.9 Re = = 486,000. [Ans.] 0.212 The water is clearly flowing under turbulent conditions. The numerical value of the heat transfer coefficient h, Eq. (8.60), is a function of the physical properties of the fluid, its rate of flow, and the diameter or effective diameter of the coolant channel. These parameter s, including h, can conveniently be grouped together into three dimensionless quantitie s-the Reynolds number, already discussed ; the Nusselt numbet; Nu, defined as hDe Nu= -_. k ' (8.86)

All of these parameters must be specified, of course, in consistent units. It can be shown both from an analysis of experiments and from theory that convective heat transfer data can be correlated in tenns of three dimensionless numbers-Re, Nu, and Pro In particular, for ordinary water, heavy water, organic liquids, and most gases, all flowing through long straight channels under turbulent conditions, these data can be represented by an equation of the fonn (8.88) where C, m, and n are constants. The value of h can be obtained from Eq. (8.88) using the definition of the Nusselt number. Thus, h = c GJ Rempr" (8.89) In using correlations of data of the type expressed by Eqs. (8.88) and (8.89)­ or any correlations, for that matter-care must be exercised to detennine the refer­ ence temperature at which the fluid properties are to be evaluated. Frequently, this is the bulk temperature of the fluid Th. It should also be noted that these equations are not valid for liquid metals, which must be considered separately. With ordinary water, heavy water, organic liquids, and gases flowing through long, straight, and circular tubes, the following values have been recommended for the constants appearing in Eqs. (8.88) and (8.89): C = 0.023, m = 0.8, and n = 0.4. [With the constants appearing in Eq. (8.88), Eq. (8.88) is known as the Dittus-Boelter equation.] These constants are often used in computing h for non­ circular coolant channels by introducing the appropriate value of De. However, significant errors in h may result if the channels deviate substantially from the cir­ cular configuration. In the important case of ordinary water flowing through a lattice of rods, parallel to the axis of the rods, recommended constants are: m = 0.8, n = 1/3, and C is given by 7 P C = 0.042 D -0.024 (8.90) 7Weisman, J., "Heat Transfer to Water Flowing Parallel to Tube Bundles," Nucl.

[Ans.] The Heat Transfer Coefficient -Liquid Metals Heat transfer to liquid metal coolants is strikingly different from the transfer of heat to ordinary fluids largely because the thennal conductivities of liquid metals are so much higher than those of other types of coolants. At 400oP, for instance, the thennal conductivity of liquid sodium is 46.4 Btulhr-ft- Op, whereas it is only 0.381 Btulhr-ft_oF for ordinary water and 0.115 Btulhr-ft-Op for helium at 1 atm. Thus, at this temperature, the conductivity of sodium is 122 times that of water and 400 times that of helium. One important effect of the high conductivity of liquid metals is that, even when they are flowing under turbulent conditions, these coolants absorb heat mostly by conduction. This is in marked contrast to the situation with nonmetal­ lic coolants, where, it is recalled, heat transfer occurs largely as the result of the internal motions of the fluid.

 text: Sec. 8.5 Boiling Heat Transfer 441 Since heat flows into a liquid metal primarily by conduction, the temperature distribution within a coolant channel containing a liquid metal resembles the tem­ perature distribution in a solid conductor whose axis and circumference are held at different temperature s. Thus, as shown in Fig. 8.9, the temperature varies more slowly across the channel with a liquid metal than with a nonmetallic coolant. In both cases, the bulk temperature of the coolant is given by Eq. (8.61). The heat transfer coefficient for liquid metals has been studied extensively in recent years, and correlations have been given that cover most of the situations encountered in practice. For the case of a liquid metal flowing under turbulent conditions through a hexagonal lattice of rods, parallel to the rods, Dwyer (see References at the end of the chapter) has given the following correlation: Nu = 6.66 + 3.126(sld) + 1.184(sld)2 + 0.0155(\{JPe)o.86 (8.92) where sid is the ratio of lattice pitch to rod diameter, \{J is a function given graph­ ically by Dwyer that has been fitted by Hubbard8 by the expression _ 0.942(sld)1.4 \{J = 1 ------­ Pr(Rel 103) 1.281 ' and Pe is the so-called Peelet number, which is given by Devpcp Pe = Re x Pr = . k (8.93) (8.94) Equation (8.92) is valid only for lattices with sid > 1.35. Values of the Nusselt number for more closely spaced hexagonal lattices are given in tabular form by Dwyer, Berry, and Hlavac (see References). Equations (8.92) and (8.93) may be used for square lattices by replacing the ratio sid in these expressions by 1.075(sld)s, where (sld)s is the value of sid for the square array. For tightly packed square lattices, the following correlation may be used: Nu = 0.48 + 0.0133(Pe)o.7o (8.95) 8.5 BOILING HEAT TRANSFER Up to this point, it has been assumed that a liquid coolant does not undergo a change in phase as it moves along a coolant channel absorbing heat from the fuel. It was assumed that the coolant does not boil. However, there are some distinct advantages in permitting a reactor coolant to boil. For one thing, the coolant pres- . sure is much lower when the coolant is allowed to boil than when boiling must be 8F. R. Hubbard III, private communication.

 text: 442 Heat Removal from Nuclear Reactors Chap. 8 prevented. In addition, for a given flow rate and heat flux, lower cladding and fuel temperature are required for a boiling than for a nonboiling coolant. For these rea­ sons, boiling of a restricted nature is now pennitted in pressurized water reactors, although steam is not produced directly in these reactors. With boiling water reac­ tors not only is advantage taken of higher heat transfer rates, but, as pointed out in Chapter 4, by producing steam within these reactors, the entire secondary coolant loop of the PWR can be eliminated. Boiling coolants other than ordinary water have been considered in a num­ ber of reactor concepts, but none of these has reached a practical stage of develop­ ment. Therefore, the following discussion pertains largely to water-cooled reactors. However, the principles to be considered also apply to other types of liquid-co oled reactors. Boiling Regimes To understand the phenomenon of boiling heat transfer, consider an experiment in which the heat flux (Btu!hr-ft2 or W/cm2) from heated fuel rods to a flowing liquid coolant is measured as a function of the temperature of the surface of the rods for a given system pressure and flow rate. The results of such an experiment are shown in Fig. 8.10. As indicated in the figure, the heat flux increases slowly as the rod In q� No I Nucleate I boiling T boiling -: I .

 text: Sec. 8.5 Boiling Heat Transfer 443 temperature is increased at low values. In this temperature range, between points A and B in Fig. 8.10, heat is transferred to the coolant by ordinary convection with no change in phase, and the heat transfer coefficient is determined by the correlations given in the preceding section. As the surface temperature of the fuel is increased further, a point is eventu­ ally reached where bubbles of vapor begin to form at various imperfections on the surface of the fuel rods. This occurs at about the point B in Fig. 8.10, and is a form of boiling called nucleate boiling. As the bubbles are formed, they are carried away from the rods and into the body of the coolant as a result of the turbulent motions of the fluid. However, as long as the bulk temperature of the coolant is less than its saturation temperature, the vapor in the bubbles soon condenses to the liquid state and the bubbles disappear from the coolant. There is no net production of steam under these circumsta nces, and the boiling process is termed subcooled nucleate boiling or local boiling. If and when the bulk temperature of the coolant reaches its saturation temperature, the bubbles persist within the coolant stream, there begins to be a net output of steam, and the system is now said to be undergoing saturated nucleate boiling or bulk boiling. The onset of local boiling and the transition to bulk boiling are shown in the lower two portions of Fig. 8.11 for a fluid flowing vertically through a heated pipe.

page number: 462
 text: 444 Heat Removal from Nuclear Reactors Chap. 8 With local boiling, as indicated in the figure, bubbles exist only near the surface of the pipe, and most of the pipe is filled with liquid. In the region with bulk boiling, however, the bubbles are distributed throughout the fluid, which is said to move in bubbly flow. Under certain condition s-namely, at high-flow velocities and a large concentration of bubbles (large void fractions)-the bubbles combine to form a void space along the center of the channel. This is called annular flow. In any event, with the onset of nucleate boiling, heat moves readily into the liquid. At every temperature in this region between Band C in Fig. 8.10, heat transfer is more efficient than by ordinary convection. There are two reasons for this. First, heat is removed from the rods both as heat of vaporization and as sen­ sible heat. Second, the motions of the bubbles lead to rapid mixing of the fluid. The rapid increase in the heat flux with temperature, shown by the steep slope of the nucleate boiling region in Fig. 8.10, is explained by the fact that the density of bubbles forming at and departing from the rod surface increases rapidly with surface temperature. For ordinary water at pressures between 500 and 2,000 psia undergoing nucle­ ate boiling, either local or bulk, the heat flux can be computed from the following correlation: 9 (8.96) where Tc is the surface temperature of the cladding (OF), Tsat is the saturation tem­ perature (OF), P is the system pressure (psia), and q" is the heat flux in Btulhr-ft2 Equation (8.96) is known as the lens and Lottes correlation and is valid for any channel geometry. This correlation is not valid, however, if the coolant is undergo­ ing annular flow. It is important to estimate the fuel surface temperature TLB at which local boiling begins to know which correlation to use for calculating heat flow into the coolant-a correlation for convective heat transfer or the Jens and Lottes equation. Although there is no single, fixed temperature at which boiling starts, TLB is usually computed from the simple formula (8.97) In this equation, Tsat is again the saturation temperature, (Tc -Tsat)JL is the dif­ ference between the cladding and saturation temperatures as computed from the Jens and Lottes correlation, q" is the heat flux, and h is the convective heat transfer coefficient. The application of some of the prior results is illustrated in Fig. 8.12, which shows the parameters of the water coolant in a boiling-water reactor as a function 9W. H. lens and P. A.

The skewing of q" away from

page number: 464
 text: 446 Heat Removal from Nuclear Reactors Chap. 8 the bottom of the core is due to the presence of control rods in this region. The cal­ culated value of TLB and the outer cladding temperature Tc are the same-namely, 558°F approximately 13 in up the channel. Local boiling commences at this point. The bulk temperature of the water increases steadily from its entering value of 526°F at the bottom of the core and reaches the saturation temperature of 548.7°F about 45 in along the channel. It is at this point that bulk boiling begins. Thus, the heat transfer is convective for about the first 13 in up the channel, local boiling occurs between 13 in and 45 in, and throughout the rest of the channel the water undergoes bulk boiling. (The flow never becomes annular.) It should be observed in Fig. 8.12 that the difference in temperature between the cladding and the coolant, after rising in the convective region in response to an increasing q", drops sharply after the onset of nucleate boiling at 13 in, although q" is still increasing. This illustrates how readily heat flows into a boiling coolant. It should also be noted in Fig. 8.12 that the void fraction of the coolant starts to rise from zero at about the point where local boiling begins, although there is no net production of steam until the onset of bulk boiling further up the channel. The reason for this is that, although the steam bubbles that fonn at the rod surface collapse as they pass into the interior of the channel, their place at the surface is immediately taken by other bubbles. As a consequence, there is always a steady­ state distribution of voids across the channel. The Boiling Crisis To return to the discussion of the experiment depicted in Fig. 8.10, if the temper­ ature of the fuel surface is increased in the nucleate boiling region, the density of bubbles at or near the surface of the fuel rods also increases. Eventually, however, a point is reached where the bubble density becomes so great that adjacent bub­ bles coalesce and begin to fonn a vapor film across the surface of the rods. At this point, which corresponds to the point C in Fig. 8.10, the system is said to be in a boiling crisis or in a condition leading to a departure/rom nucleate boiling (DNB). The heat flux at or just before the boiling crisis is called the critical heat flux, (CHF) and denoted as q;. Sometimes, for reasons that are evident momentarily, q; is called the burnout flux. With the onset of the boiling crisis, the heat flux into the coolant begins to drop. This is due to the fact, that over the regions of the rods covered by vapor film, the heat is forced to pass through the vapor into the coolant by conduction and radiation. both of which are comparatively inefficient mechanisms for heat transfer. The heat flux continues to drop, more or less erratically (as indica ted by the dotted lines in Fig. 8.10), with increasing fuel temperatures as the total area of the film covering the fuel increases. In this region of Fig. 8.10, the system is said to be experiencing partial film boiling.

page number: 465
 text: Sec. 8.5 Boiling Heat Transfer 447 Eventually, when the rod surface temperature is high enough, the vapor film covers the entire rod and the heat flux to the coolant falls to a minimum value (point D). Beyond this point, any increase in temperature leads to an increase in the heat flux simply because heat transfer through the film, although a poor and inefficient process, nevertheless increases with the temperature difference across the film. The system, in this case, is said to be undergoing full film boiling. The existence of the various boiling regimes and the boiling crisis is an im­ portant consideration in the design of a liquid-cooled reactor, as may be seen from the following example. Suppose that a water-cooled reactor is designed and/or op­ erated in such a manner that at some point along a coolant channel the water un­ dergoes nucleate boiling near DNB conditions. If the reactor power is suddenly increased so that the heat flux into the water rises above the DNB value of q;, partial film boiling will immediately begin in this channel. However, as explained previously, the formation of the film impedes the transfer of heat to the coolant. As a consequence, the heat confined, so to speak, within the fuel raises the fuel temperature and the surface temperature of the rods-forming the channel. This, in tum, leads to an increase in the area of the film, which leads to a further de­ crease in the heat flux, a further increase in rod surface temperature, and so on. In this way, the wall temperature rapidly increases along the boiling curve from point C to point E. Long before E is reached, however, the temperature of the fuel will attain such high values (several thousands of degrees Fahrenheit) that the fuel will partially melt, the cladding will rupture, and fission products will be released into the coolant. As noted earlier, these are occurrences that must be prevented at all costs. For this reason, it is important to know the value of q; and to keep a reactor from operating near the DNB point. It must not be implied from Fig. 8.10 that it is necessary to have saturated nucleate boiling (bulk boiling) before the onset of the boiling crisis. The figure was intended merely to show that there are two types of nucleate boiling and that it is possible to make the transition from subcooled to saturated boiling if the bulk tem­ perature of the coolant exceeds the saturation temperature. Bubbles at the surface of the fuel can combine to form areas of vapor film, the beginning of the boiling crisis, although the bubbles would condense if they traveled to the interior of the coolant stream. A great many correlations have been developed from data on q; (see Tong in the References for a tabulation of these correlations). As would be expected, these correlations differ depending on whether the boiling crisis is reached from sub­ cooled or bulk boiling conditions. For subcooled boiling, the following correlation by Jens and Lottes 10 has been widely used: lOW. H. lens and P. A. Lottes, ibid.

De + Di De' (8.99) (8.100) (8.101) In these expressions, Twe is the wall (cladding) temperature at the onset of the boiling crisis, Tb is the bulk temperature , P is the pressure in psia, v is the coolant velocity in ftlsec, De is the equivalent diameter in feet, and Di is defined as the heated perimeter of a channel in feet divided by n. The Bernath correlation is valid for pressures between 23 and 3,000 psia, fluid velocities between 4.0 and 54 ftlsec, and for De between 0.143 and 0.66 in. Example S.10 For the PWR lattice described in Examples 8.3 through 8.8, calculate for the onset of the boiling crisis the: (a) cladding temperature, (b) heat transfer coefficient, and (c) critical heat flux.

With a bulk water temperature of about 600°F from Example 8.6, the critical heat flux is Equations (8.89) through (8.101) provide estimates of the curve that best rep­ resents the mass of necessarily rather scattered heat transfer data. The curve passes more or less through the center of gravity of the data points. In the case of the approach to DNB from bulk boiling conditions, workers at the General Electric Company (GE) have developed correlations that form an envelope of the lowest measured values of q;. With bulk boiling, such correlations depend on the flow quality of the coolant denoted by the symbol X, which is defined as mass flow rate of vapor (lb/hr-ft2) X = mass flow rate of vapor�liquid mixture (lb/hr-ft2) . The GE correlation, due to Janssen and Levy,12 is as follows: where /I :�6 = 0.705 + 0.237(G/106), X < Xl /I :�6 = 1.634 -0.270(G /106) -4.710X, Xl < X < X2 /I :�6 = 0.605 -0.164(G/106) -0.653X, X2 < X, Xl = 0.197 -0.108(G/106), X2 = 0.254 -0.026(G/106), (8.102) (8.103) (8.104) (8.105) (8.106) (8.107) 12E.

 text: 450 Heat Removal from Nuclear Reactors Chap. 8 and G is again the mass flux in Iblhr-ft2 These equations refer to a system pressure of 1,000 psia. For other pressures, q; can be found from q; (P) = q; (1,000 psia) + 400(1,000 -P). (8.108) The GE correlation is valid for pressures between 600 and 1450 psia, G from 0.4 x 106 to 6.0 x 106Iblhr-ft2, values of X up to 0.45, De from 0.245 to 1.25 in, and for coolant channels between 29 and 108 in. in length. All of the foregoing correlations for the critical heat flux were developed largely from data for circular pipes. When used to determine q; for noncircular channels or for coolant flowing through lattices of fuel rods, these correlations can be counted on to provide only the roughest approximations for q;. Various correction factors for the various geometries have been developed, however, but these are too detailed to be discussed here (see Tong in the References). 8.6 THERMAL DESIGN OF A REACTOR As pointed out earlier in this chapter, reactors must be designed in such a way that the fission products remain confined within the fuel at all times-throughout the operational lifetime of the core, during shutdown, and under accident conditions, when the fuel may be denied normal cooling. This places upper limits on the tem­ perature of the fuel and/or its cladding. The currently accepted design criterion is that the integrity of the cladding must be maintained through all operating con­ ditions. Since the expansion of the fuel on melting can rupture the cladding, this design criterion is essentially equivalent to the requirement that the fuel must not melt. The melting point of 002 which depends somewhat on bum up-that is, on the fraction of the fissile atoms that have undergone fission-is generally between 5,000°F and 5,100°F (2,760 °C and 2,815°C) for commercially available 002. In most reactors fueled with 002, the maximum fuel temperature is somewhat below 4,500°F (2,480°C). In the HTGR, where the fuel consists of small particles of uranium and tho­ rium dicarbide in a carbonaceous binder, the maximum permitted fuel temperature is about 6,500°F (3,600°C). Natural or enriched uranium metal melts at 2,070°F (1,132°C), but it also undergoes two changes in solid phase (alteration in crystalline structure )-first at 1,234°F (668°C) and again at 1,425°F (774°C). However, above about 750°F (400°C), the strength of the metal decreases rapidly. This permits fission product gases to gather and diffuse into pockets in the fuel, which in tum leads to the ex­ pansion of the fuel and to cladding failure. Therefore, it is usual practice to design uranium metal-fueled reactors with maximum fuel temperatures below 750°F. This
