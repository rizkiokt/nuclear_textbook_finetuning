 text: 11 Reactor Licensing, Safety, and the Environment All engineering structures and devices-b uildings, bridges, dams, vehicles, manu­ facturing plants, electrical machinery, and so on-inherently present some element of risk to their owners or operators and to the public at large. Nuclear reactors are no exception in this regard. However, at times, the risk of nuclear reactors has been unduly exaggerated, in some measure because of an innate fear of nuclear radiation on the part of the public, and also because of the memory of the awesome effects of the nuclear weapons employed in World War II. In fact, the risks from nuclear power are extremely low when compared with risks commonly accepted in other fonns of human endeavor. To date, the safety record of the nuclear power industry has been excellent. This is the result of the recognition by both industry and government of the central role that safety must play in the design and operation of every nuclear installation. In terms of current technology, nuclear power is one of the least, environ­ mentally hannful ways of producing large amounts of electrical power. However, nuclear power plants do discharge small amounts of radioactivity to their envi­ ronments. This aspect of nuclear power is discussed in the closing section of the chapter. 612

 text: Sec. 11.1 Governmental Authority and Responsibility 613 11.1 GOVERNMENTAL AUTHO RITY AND RESPONSIBI LITY The ultimate responsibility for protection of the public in any country rests with the local or national government. The manner in which this responsibility is exer­ cised in the case of nuclear energy varies somewhat from country to country. The present discussion is confined to procedures currently in effect in the United States. It is reasonable to outline the governmental function first, before considering the technology of reactor safety, for much of the philosophy and most of the technical requirements related to safety stem from government regulations. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission In the United States, the authority for federal government involvement in and reg­ ulation of any activity originates in acts of Congress. The first legislation related to the development and regulation of nuclear energy was the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, also known as the McMahon Act. This act was greatly expanded by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Both acts established a five-man Atomic Energy Com­ mission and spelled out in some detail the mandate of the Commission in nuclear matters. In general terms, the Acts also provided for the establishment of an orga­ nization or agency-loosely called the "AEC" to distinguish the agency from the five-man Commissi on-to carry out the various functions of the Commission, in­ cluding "the regulation of the production and utilization of atomic energy and the facilities related thereto ... The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 also stated that "it is the purpose of this Act to effectuate a program to encourage the wide spread participation in the development and utilization of atomic energy. . "This provision of the Act was increasingly criticized over the years for placing the Commission in the position of being simultaneously the promoter and regulator of nuclear energy-ro les that conceivably could conflict with one another. To correct this situation, Congress en­ acted the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974. This act (1) abolished the Atomic Energy Commission; (2) consolidated into a new agency, the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA), the research and development activities of the AEC and several other government agencies; and (3) transferred to a new Nu­ clear Regulatory Commission (and its agency, the NRC) all of the licensing and regulatory functions previously performed by the AEC. In 1977, in an effort to further consolidate the energy programs of the federal government, Congress merged ERDA and several other energy-related agencies into a new, Cabinet-level Department of Energy (DOE). The structure and func­ tions of the NRC were not affected by this reorganizati on. The NRC remains an independent agency, not included within DOE. Thus, federally sponsored research and development programs in nuclear energy are carried out under the auspices of the DOE. The NRC continues to license and regulate nuclear activities in the

 text: 614 Reactor Licensing Chap. 11 United States under the provisions of the 1954 and 1974 Acts, as amended. It also sponsors confinna tory research in support of these activities. Like most acts of Congress, the 1954 and 1974 Acts are written in general tenns. In order to specify in detail how it conducts its business, the NRC promul­ gates its own rules and regulations. These become part of the Code of Federal Reg­ ulations (CFR), a master manual for the operations of the executive departments and agencies of the federal government. These regulations have the force and effect of law. The CPR is divided into 50 sections called titles, each of which represents a broad subject area of federal regulation. Each title, in tum, is divided into chapters, which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Title 10, Chapter I, is reserved for the regulations of the NRC. Each chapter of the CFR is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas. For example, Part 20 of Title 10 estab­ lishes standards for radiation protection; Part 50 gives the regulations whereby the Commission licenses reactors; and so on. At the time of this writing, there are 37 parts (not numbered consecutively) to Title 10. Those parts most frequently en­ countered in connection with nuclear power plants are described in Table 11.1. Each part of Title lOis denoted in abbreviated fonn, as in 10 CFR 20, 10 CFR 50, etc. Specific paragraphs or topics within each part are also numbered. For example, 10 CFR 20.4 defines units of radiation dose; 10 CFR 50.34 describes the technical infonnation that must be furnished to the NRC by an applicant for a reactor license; and so on. In addition to the regulations published in 10 CFR, the NRC occasionally is­ sues Regulatory Guides. The purpose of these guides is to (1) describe the methods the NRC regul atory staff finds acceptable in implementing the regulations con­ tained in 10 CFR; (2) discuss the techniques used by the staff in evaluating specific problems or postulated nuclear accidents; and (3) provide general guidance to ap­ plicants for NRC licenses. The guides are not substitutes for the regulations, and compliance with them is not required. However, from a practical standpoint, they are becoming an increasingly important part of the overall NRC regulatory process. 11.2 REACTOR LICENSING The responsibility of the NRC for the regulation of nuclear energy extends over the whole fuel cycle, from the mining and processing of uranium ore through the utilization of the fuel in reactors, the transportation and reprocessing of spent fuel, and, finally, the disposal of radioactive wastes. The present discussion is largely restricted to the regulation of nuclear power plants. NRC regulatory authority is implemented through the issuance of various li­ censes. Considerable effort is nonnally required, both by the applicant for a reactor

Although the granting of an NRC license is usually considered to be the major licensing action in the case of a nuclear power plant, all the various permits and licenses issued by other federal, state, and local authorities for construction of ordinary fossil fuel plants must al so be secured. Often, this entails 40 or more separate licensing actions. As a result,

page number: 634
 text: 616 Reactor Licensi ng Chap. 11 resolution of licensing problems associated with the permits or licenses needed to construct or to operate nuclear power plants usually requires several years. Several groups within the NRC are involved in reactor licensing, including the following: Regulatory Staff. As in any other large enterprise, the NRC staff is di­ vided into a number of separate offices that perform specially assigned functions within the organizati on. In practice, an applicant proposing to build a nuclear plant interacts primarily with staff members in the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR) and the Office of Inspection and Enforcement (IE). NRR personnel perform all the licensing functions associated with the construction and operation of nuclear reactors and with the receipt, possession, ownership, and use of nuclear fuel at these facilities. NRR staff reviews applications and issues licenses for reactor facilities after evaluating the health, safety, and environmental aspects of the facilities. NRR is also responsible for the licensing of reactor operators. When and if a plant reaches the construction stage, IE personnel inspect the project on a continuing basis to assure that the plant is constructed according to the NRC construction permit and related specificat ions. Later, when the plant is operational, other IE personnel monitor its operations to see that these are carried out in keeping with the provisions of the operating license. Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS). This com­ mittee, which consists of a maximum of 15 members, was established by Congress in 1957, in an amendment to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, to review all power reactor license applications with regard to potential hazards and to report thereon to the Commission. The members of ACRS are not regular employees of the NRC. Atomic Safety and Licensing Boards (ASL B). These boards conduct hearings and make decisions with respect to the granting, suspending, revoking, or amending of any license authorized by the Atomic Energy Act. Each board consists of three members . One member (usually an attorney) must be qualified to conduct a hearing and serves as the chairman of the board. The other two members are drawn from the ranks of technology. (Because of the increasing importance of environmental questions in power plant hearings, one of the two technical members of the board is frequently a life scientist of one type or another.) Steps in Licensing The NRC has adopted two different approaches to the licensing of nuclear power plants. The original method was derived from the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. This process involves a construction phase and an operating phase. Under this approach, before a reactor can be built at a particular site, a construction permit (CP) must

page number: 635
 text: Sec. 11.2 Reactor Licensing 617 be obtained from the NRC. Before the reactor can be operated, an operating li­ cense (OL) must be obtained. The licensing process is thus divided into two stages, nonnally referred to as the CP stage and the OL stage. A long sequence of steps, which have become formalized in NRC procedur es, are involved in each stage. In condensed fonn, these steps, which are illustrated in Fig. 11.1, are as follows: The CP Stage Informal Site Review. The selection of the site for a nuclear power plant is the responsibility of the applicant proposing to build the plant. However, the NRC must ultimately approve the site, on the basis of criteria to be discussed in Section 11.6. Once a site has been selected, the applicant is encouraged, but not required, to ask the NRC for an infonnal review of the site before proceeding with a fonnal application for a license. In the Environmental Report (see Step 2), the applicant must compare the merits of at least two alternate sites. Application for License. The applicant files an application with the NRC for an operating license for the facility, although at this stage, only a con­ struction pennit can be received. The application is not a fonnidable document. It contains such infonnation as the names and addresses of the major officers of the applicant 's organization, the state of incorporation, evidence of financial qualifications to undertake the project, and so on. The infonnation required for an application is given in 10 CFR 50.33. In support of the application, the applicant must submit technical infonnati on, appropriate data for antitrust evaluation, and an environmental report. The largest and most difficult items to prepare are the following two documents: the Prelim­ inary Safety Analysis Report (PSAR) and the Applicant's Environmental Report (AER).l The PSAR is a major technical document, usually on the order of five vol­ umes in length. The required content in a PSAR is specified in 10 CFR 50.34 and Regulatory Guide 1.70. Roughly speaking, the PSAR contains comprehensive data on the proposed site; a description of the proposed facility, with special consid­ eration of safety-related features; a discussion of hypothetical accident situations and their consequence s; a prelimina ry plan for the organization of personnel at the facility and for the conduct of operations; and plans for coping with emergencies. The requirement for the submission of the AER stems from the National En­ vironmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA, Public Law 91-190, 1970). 1 The NRC publishes two documents that are valuable aids for those preparing or reviewing these reports. The Standard Review Plan outlines the Commission's safety criteria and the Environ­ mental Standard Review Plan lists environmental guidelines. The NRC staff now must identify and document any deviations from these criteria; in the future, this responsibility will be shifted to the applicant.

 text: Sec. 11.2 Reactor Licensing 619 According to this Act all agencies of the Federal Government shall include in every recommendation for major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, a detailed statement by the responsible official on- (i) the environmental impact of the proposed action, (ii) any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should the pro­ posal be implemented, (iii) alternatives to the proposed action, (iv) the relationship between local short-term uses of man's environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-tenn productivity, and (v) any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources which would be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented. The issuance of a construction pennit or operating license by the NRC is a "major Federal action," and, accordingly, the NRC requires each applicant to submit the AER, from which the NRC prepares its Environmental Statement, dis­ cussed next. The contents of the AER are based largely on items (i) through (v), together with evidence that the proposed facility complies with various environ­ mental standards and regulations. The detailed content of an AER is given in 10 CFR 51 and Regulatory Guide 4.2. Once the application and it� supporting documentation have been received, checked for complete ness, and accepted ("docketed"), the NRC publishes a notice of its receipt in the Federal Register2 and places copies of all the documentation and correspondence in Public Document Rooms in Washington, D.C., and in the locale of the proposed plant. Simultaneously, copies of the documentation are dis­ tributed to members of the ACRS and to cognizant members of the NRC regulatory staff. The applicant is required to serve a copy of the application and supporting documents on the chief executive of the municipality or county in which the facil­ ity is to be built and to notify the chief executives of municipalities or counties that are identified as locations of alternative sites. Review by Regulatory Staff. The NRC regulatory staff reviews the ap­ plicant's documentation to detennine whether the facility can be constructed with­ out undue risk to the health and safety of the public and without unacceptable environmental impact. If, in the opinion of the staff, some aspect of the facility is unacceptable, the applicant is requested to make the necessary modificat ions. If the applicant cannot or will not do so, the conflict in views must be resolved 2The Federal Register, a journal of the regulatory activities of the departments and agencies of the executive branch of the government, is published by the National Archives and Records Service of the General Services Administration. New regulations are published first in the Federal Register. When extracted and codified, they become part of the CFR.

 text: 620 Reactor Licensing Chap. 11 prior to issuance of the construction permit or operating license. In the extreme case, the application could be denied by the Commission. Following the review of the applicant's documen tation, the staff then issues a Safety Evaluation Report (SER), which summarizes its findings and its conclusion that the facility can, in its judgment, be constructed without undue risk to the health and safety of the public. The staff also conducts a review of the AER (this is called the NEPA review), and issues a Draft Environmental Statement (DES), summarizing the results of its evaluation of the environmental impact of the plant. The DES is then circulated to other federal, state, and local government agencies concerned with environmental matters for their comment or corroborati on. Subsequently, the staff issues its Fi­ nal Environmental Statement (FES), incorporating these comments and issues its conclusions. Review by ACRS. The documentation pertaining to the application is first assigned to a subcommit tee of ACRS members. When the subcommittee has com­ pleted its review, and usually after the NRC staff has issued its SER, the full com­ mittee considers the project. Under its present charter, the ACRS is not responsible for reviewing the environmental impact of the proposed facility. The findings and recommendations of the committee are reported by letter to the chairman of the commission. Following the meetings of the ACRS, the regulatory staff issues a Supple­ ment to the Safety Evaluation Report (SSER). This supplemental report addr esses any safety issues raised by the ACRS and includes any new information that has become available since the issuance of the SER. Public Hearin gs. After the staff's FES and SSER and the ACRS letter have been issued, a public hearing is held before an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board to consider whether the Commission should issue a CP. Public notice of these hearings, which are held in the vicinity of the proposed site, is issued and sent to local news media. According to the provisions of the 1954 Act, any person whose interests may be affected by issuance of the CP may intervene in and become a party to the proceedi ngs. To do so, the person must file a petition identifying what aspect of the project to be intervened in and explaining the interest and the basis of the contentions. The ASLB receives comments on the intervenor's petition from the regulatory staff and the applicant. If it then rules in favor of the intervention, the hearings are said to be contested. The public hearings may be carried out in two stages. First, hearings are held to consider environmental and site-related issues. If, at the conclusion of these hearings, the Board determines (I) that the plant can be constructed without undue harm to the environment and (2) that there is reasonable assurance that the site is a suitable location for the plant, the Board may provide the applicant with a Lim-

page number: 639
 text: Sec. 11.2 Reactor Licensing 621 ited Work Authorization (LWA). The LWA pennits the applicant to begin prepa­ ration of the site for construction of the facility, including erection of construction support facilities, excavation for plant structures, construction of roadways and railroad spurs, installation of lighting and sewage systems, and other site-related matters. Following the environmental hearings, the Board holds hearings on the safety-related issues concerning the plant. In uncontested hearings, the applicant 's testimony consists of the application and supporting documentati on, including the PSAR, AER, and amendments, to each that inevitably are added during the course of the staff review. The staff's testimony includes its SER, SSER, and FES. In contested hearings, the appli­ cant, the staff, and the intervenors provide additional testimony on points at issue. Courtroom-style adjudicatory procedures are followed, including the right of all parties to present and cross-examine witnesses. At the close of the hearings, the Board considers the record that has been compiled, together with findings of fact and conclusions of law filed independently by the parties. The Board then issues what is known as its initial decision. If the decision of the Board is favorable and the hearings are uncontested, the NRC Di­ rector of Nuclear Regulation, acting for the Commission, issues a CP, and work can begin in earnest on the plant. Frequently, the CP is issued with conditions, based on issues that are not entirely resolved to the Board's satisfaction, but for which there is every reason to believe can be resolved at a later date. Appeals. Any party not satisfied with the initial decision may indepen­ dently "file except ions" (i.e., appeal the decision). The Commission handles the appeal. The Commission reviews the record of the Licensing Board with regard to fact and law. This is the last step available to a dissatisfied party within the administrative (executive) branch of the federal government. If, at this point, the Commission does not overule the Licensing Board, the aggrieved party may take his case to court-a federal court, as the issues involve federal law. The OL Stage Much of the procedure that must be followed at this stage of the licensing process is a repeat of what was done earlier at the CP stage. Submittal for Operating License. If a CP has been successfully ob­ tained, the applicant has presumably begun to build the plant. When the construc­ tion has reached the point where all of the design details have been worked out and the plans for operation of the facility have been finalized, the applicant submits to the NRC an amendment to the original application in the form of a Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR), an updated Environmental Report, and a request for the issuance of an operating license.

 text: 622 Reactor Licensing Chap. 11 Review by Regula tory Staff. The thrust of the staff review at this point is: (1) to detennine whether any new infonnation has come to light since the is­ suance of the CP, either regarding the specific facility itself or in nuclear technol­ ogy, in general, that could have a bearing on the safe or environmentally sound operation of the facility; (2) to establish, by further review of design, operating plans, organizati on, and site inspections, that the facility has, in fact, been con­ structed according to the plans on which the issuance of the pennit was based; (3) to assure the plant will operate in confonnity with the application (as amended) and the rules and regulations of the Commission; (4) to gain reasonable assurance that operations are conducted without danger to the public; and (5) to verify the technical and financial qualifications of the applicant. Following its evaluation, the Staff issues a new Safety Evaluation Report. Review by ACRS. The ACRS makes another independent safety review of the facility and again sends its recommendations to the chainnan of the Com­ mission. Hearings. A public hearing before an ASLB is not required by law at the OL state. However, public notice is required on the pending issuance of an OL, to give another opportunity for an expression of public interest by way of a petition to intervene. If there is substantial public interest in the facility or if a hearing is requested by someone whose interest may be affected, then the Commission will order that a hearing be held. The decision-m aking process at this stage, including the right of interventi on, is essentially the same as at the CP stage. If the board's decision is favorable, the OL is issued. Appeals. If the initial decision of the ASLB is not satisfactory in the view of an intervenor, several levels of appeal are open. These are the same at the OL stage as they are at the CP stage. Licensing under 10 CFR 52 Recently, the Commission adopted a new approach for licensing reactors which is defined in 10 CFR Part 52. Under this approach, the NRC seeks early res­ olution of safety issues to facilitate standardization and simplification of the licensing process. The new approach utilizes the issuance of early site per­ mits, design certification rulemaking, and combined construction and operating pennits. A critical element in this new process is the concept of design certification. Under 10 CFR 52, a rulemaking may be requested that accepts a specific nuclear power plant design. Anyone who then decides to purchase and build this design may reference the certification in the application for a construction pennit and for an operating license or for a combined construction pennit and operating license.

page number: 641
 text: Sec. 11.3 Principles of Nuclear Power Plant Safety 623 This means that the purchaser need not be subjected to a complete review of the design, as was the case under 10 CFR 50. Another new aspect of the licensing process under 10 CFR 52 is the com­ bined construction pennit and operating license. The combined license enables an applicant to avoid issuance of a construction permit and then a separate operating license. The application is still subject to safety, environmental, and antitrust re­ view, as in the case of the separate pennitting and licensing process of 10 CFR 50. 11.3 PRINCIPL ES OF NUCLEAR POWER PLANT SAFETY The unique feature of nuclear power plants, as distinct from other power-generating facilities, is the presence of large amounts of radioactive materials, primarily the fission products. As has been noted previously in this book, the central safety prob­ lem in the design of a nuclear plant is to assure that, insofar as is possible or practi­ cal, these fission products remain safely confined at all times-during the operation of the plant, refueling of the reactor, and preparation and shipping of spent fuel. Multiple Barriers To prevent the escape of radioactivity, nuclear plants are designed using the concept of multiple barriers. These barriers represent a sequence of obstacles (not all of them physical) to block the passage of radioactive atoms from the fuel, or wherever they may originate, to the surrounding population. The barriers nonnally present are the following: The Fuel Except in the MSBR (see Section 4.5), the fissile and fissionable material is located within solid fuel elements-as natural or enriched uranium, in an oxide or carbide fonn, or in a dilute alloy of a structural material such as zirconium, aluminum, or stainless steel. Because fission fragments are emitted in fission as highly ionized particles, they are strongly attenuated, and, except for those fragments originating near the surface of the fuel, they all come to rest within the fuel. Subsequently, however, those fission products that are gases, namely, the isotopes of iodine, xenon, and krypton (the latter two are noble gases ), undergo diffusion and may escape from the fuel. In PWR and BWR fuel rods, the gases that escape from the surface of the V02 pellets are held in the pellet-cladding gap and are collected in a small plenum provided at the end of each fuel rod. The release of fission-product gases from U02 is highly temperature depen­ dent and is also a function of the bumup of the fuel. Up to a bumup of approxi­ mately 20,000 megawatt-days/ton of V02, less than 1 % of the gases escape from a pellet, provided that the temperature is less than 3,043°F. At temperatures above 3,043°F, recrystallization of U02 occurs and between 50 and 100% of the gases

page number: 642
 text: 624 Reactor Licensing Chap. 11 may be released from the fuel before it melts. Above the melting point, about 5,OOO°F, all of the fission product gases are released. Cladding To prevent the fission product gases from escaping, and to con­ fine fission fragments emitted near the surface of the fuel, the fuel is surrounded by a layer of cladding. In some reactors, this cladding is bonded directly onto the fuel, as in the HTGR, where each fuel particle is coated with layers of pyrolytic carbon and silicon carbide (both ceramics). In other reactors, namely, the PWR and BWR, the cladding consists of hollow metal tubes into which the fuel pellets are inserted. Although Zircaloy is widely used for cladding, stainless steel cladding has also been used in some commercial reactors. During the normal operation of a reactor, leaks can be expected to develop in the cladding of a few fuel elements (recall that a PWR or BWR of moderate size has several tens of thousands of fuel rods), despite the care with which the fuel and cladding are fabricated. This ultimately leads to the escape of small amounts of radioactivity into the environment, as will be discussed in Section 11.9. Should any part of the cladding reach its melting temperature, all of the fission product gases that have accumula ted behind the cladding can escape into the coolant. Closed Coolant System In all modem power reactors, the primary coolant (i.e., the coolant that comes in contact with the fuel) moves in one or more closed loops. Fission products that have escaped from the fuel, activated atoms picked up by the coolant, and activated atoms of the coolant itself, are thus con­ fined within the coolant system. Furthermore, in most reactors, a portion of the coolant is diverted on a continuing basis into a coolant purification (cleanup) sys­ tem, where most of the fission products and other radioactive atoms are removed. Reactor Vessel Because they represent an obvious barrier to the release of radioactivity, reactor vessels are required to be designed, manufactured, and tested to meet the highest standards of quality and reliability. These requirements are spelled out in Section III of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. LWR reactor vessels are fabricated from low carbon steels to prevent embrit­ tlement that could lead to a sudden catastrophic rupture of a vessel. Great care must also be exercised in the rate of heating and cooling of a reactor vessel; changes are usually limited to about 25°C per hour. The time required to start up a power reac­ tor from cold shutdown conditions or return it to cold shutdown from operational power level is determined by the heating or cooling of the reactor ve ssel. Containment All reactors are required to be entirely enclosed by a struc­ ture of one type or another to contain radioactivity, should this be released from either the coolant system or from within the reactor vessel itself.

 text: Sec. 11.3 Principles of Nuclear Power Plant Safety 625 Figure 11.2 shows a typical containment structure for a PWR plant. This structure also serves as the building to house the entire PWR nuclear steam supply system. Most present-day PWR containment structures are made of reinforced concrete with a steel liner. Their size and thickness are dictated by the maxi­ mum temperature and pressure that would result if all of the pressurized water in the primary system were released as steam into the structure as a result of a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA), which is described in detail in Section 11.7. In some PWR plants, the pressure in the containment space is kept at slightly below Overhead crane Steam generators Reactor coolant pumps Accumulators Figure 11.2 Typical PWR containment.

 text: 626 Reactor Licensing Chap. 11 atmospheric pressure, so that leakage, at most times, through the containment wall is from the outside inward. Some plants utilize cold-water sprays near the top of the containment structure to condense the steam released during a LOCA. This reduces the pressure within the structure, thereby reducing the leakage of radioactivity from the building. Stored ice is also used for this purpose in some PWR facilities. Another measure often used is to circulate the containment at­ mosphere through various types of filters and absorption beds to remove airborne radioactivity.

 text: Sec. 11.3 Principles of Nuclear Power Plant Safety 627 BWR plants provide two levels of containment: the primary containment, which encloses the reactor, and the secondary containment, which, as does the PWR containment, more or less coincides with the reactor building. Several ver­ sions of primary containment are presently in use. Figure 11.3 shows the "light bulb and torus" system. The "light bulb," which is also called a dry well, since it is free of water, is a hollow metal shell, surrounded by concrete. Large ducts lead from the bottom of the dry well to the torus, which is normally about half-filled with water. In the event of a LOCA, the steam would be released into the dry well, pass through the ducts, and be condensed in the torus, thus relieving the pressure in the containment and reducing the likelihood of the escape of radioactivity. Figure 11.4 shows a more recent version of BWR containment in which the light bulb and torus are replaced by a large inner dry well and a suppression pool. Two levels of containment are possible with the BWR because of the compact nature of this reac- Suppression pool Shield building Containment Upper pool Reactor vessel Reactor shield wall Dry well Weir wall Horizontal vents Figure 11.4 A recent form of a BWR containment.

The prestressed concrete re­ actor vessel, holding the reactor core, heat exchangers, pumps (circulators), and so on, constitutes the primary containment. Secondary containment is the same as with the PWR and BWR, namely, a heavily built reactor building. Together, the closed cooling system and the containment structure have. proved very effective in preventing release of radioactivity to the environment in nuclear plant accidents. For example, at the Three Mile Island accident in March, 1979, only between 13 and 17 Ci of radioactive iodine were released. About lOx 106 Ci of radioactive iodine was released from the fuel when it overheated, but only about 15 Ci of this radioactivity was released to the environment. Site Location The technical aspects of reactor site selection are discussed in Section 11.6. At this point, it may merely be said that nuclear plants are con­ structed at locations that are relatively remote from large masses of people and where the plant and, in particular, the reactor vessel and the containment structures are not likely to be damaged by natural phenomena, such as earthquake s. Such siting criteria represent another important barrier to the exposure of the public to radioactivity. Evacuation The final barrier, in the event that the physical barriers are compromised or prove inadequate during an accident, is the evacuation of the local populace from areas receiving or likely to receive excessively high radiation doses. An adequate evacuation plan is an important part of the documentation that must be approved before the issuance of either a CP or an OL.3 The evacuation, even of large popUlations, is not as difficult as sometimes per­ ceived. Emergency evacuations are frequently carried out everywhere in the world, usually as the result of chemical spills, natural disasters, or wartime conditions. For example, in 1979, approximately 250,000 people were evacuated from a town near Toronto, Canada, following derailment of a train carrying chemical tank cars. Some years ago, 25,000 people were evacuated from Cicero, Illinois, because of a similar accident. In 1980, 9,000 people were evacuated from Somerville, Mas­ sachusetts, when a minor rail crash led to the release of toxic chemical s. Of course, the evacuation of millions of people from a major metropolitan center would pose 3 Although an applicant for a CP or an OL must provide such a plan, developing the evacuation plan and carrying it out, should the need arise, are the responsibility of the local governmental au­ thorities, not the applicant. If the need for evacuation appears imminent, personnel at a nuclear plant simply notify appropriate local author ities, in essentially the same way as they would do in the case of a fire. Such services are the quid pro quo for local taxes.

Three Levels of Safety The use of multiple, successive barriers to the escape of radioactivity is basic to the design of nuclear power plants. In order to assure that none of these barriers are compromised as the result of such abnormal occurrences as equipment failure, human error, or natural phenomena, the NRC has adopted the concept of the three levels of safety as its safety philosophy. These are intended to provide a kind of in-depth defense to each of the radioactivity barriers. Naturally, there is some overlap between these levels, and the division between levels in some instances tends to be arbitrary. The NRC defines each safety level by specific precepts or rules. The First Level of Safety. Precept: "Design for maximum safety in nor­ mal operation and maximum tolerance for system malfunction. Use design features inherently favorable to safe operation; emphasize quality, redundancy, inspectabil­ ity, and testability prior to acceptance for sustained commercial operation and over the plant lifetime." In brief, this first level of safety addresses the prevention of accidents by virtue of the design, construction, and surveillance of the plant. Some of the con­ siderations involved at this level are the following: 1. The reactor should have a prompt negative temperature coefficient and a neg­ ative void coefficient. 2. Only materials whose properties are known to be stable under the operating conditions of the plant, including radiation exposure, should be used for the fuel, coolant, and safety-related structures. 3. Instrumentation and controls should be provided so that the plant operators know and have control over the status of the plant at all times. Sufficient redundancy must be included so that loss of key instruments or controls does not deprive operators of needed information or does not prevent shutdown of the plant. 4. The plant must be built and equipment installed in a manner that satisfies the highest standards of engineering practice. 5. Components should be designed and installed to permit continual or periodic monitoring and inspection for signs of wear and incipient failure and to permit periodic testing of the components. The Second Level of Safety. Precept: "Assume that incidents will occur in spite of care in design, construction and operation. Provide safety systems to protect operators and the public and to prevent or minimize damage when such incidents occur."

page number: 648
 text: 630 Reactor Licensing Chap. 11 It is prudent to anticipate, despite the care taken at the first level of safety, that some failure may occur somewhere in the plant that could affect the safety of the facility. The object of the second level of safety is to protect plant personnel and the public from the consequences of such failures through the use of various safety devices and systems. Examples of considerations at this level include the following: 1. The reactor must be provided with an emergency core cooling system (ECCS) to prevent meltdown of the fuel and release of fission products due to fission product heating following a LOCA. 2. The reactor must have redundant capability for fast shutdown in the event that some of the control rods cannot be inserted, either because they are physically stuck or because of a malfunction of electrical circuitry. 3. The plant must be furnished with sources of power that are independent of the operation of the reactor to operate the ECCS, if necessary; to provide power for the continued operation of instrumentation; and to be used for other emer­ gency situations in the plant. Such emergency power includes off-site power, supplied by two physically separated access circuits, and on-site power from generators driven by fast-starting, physically separated, and redundant-in­ number diesel engines. On-site DC power for Instrumentation is normally also supplemented with storage batteries. The Third Level of Safety. Precept: "Provide additional safety systems as appropriate, based on the evaluation of effects of hypothetical accidents, where some protective systems are assumed to fail simultaneously with the accident they are intended to control." This third level of safety supplements the first two by adding a margin of safety in the event of extremely unlikely or unforeseen events. The need for addi­ tional engineered safety features is determined by analytically evaluating the effect on the plant, its associated personnel, and the public, of severe incidents arising from the simultaneous failure of various components of the facility and some of the redundant safety systems. Such events, used in this way to evaluate the overall safety of a plant and to point up the need for supplementary safety systems, are called design basis accidents (DBA) The analysis of DBAs, discussed in Section 11.7, plays an important role in the design and licensing of a nuclear power plant. Design Criteria The NRC has translated the preceding safety philosophy into a set of General Design Criteria which establish the design, fabrication, con­ struction, testing, and performance requirements for all the structure s, systems, and components that are important to the safety of the plant. These criteria, which are too lengthy to be reproduced here, are given in Appendix A of 10 CFR 50.

 text: Sec. 11.4 Dispersion of Effluents 11.4 DISPERSION OF EFFLUENTS FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES 631 All nuclear plants emit small amounts of radioactivity, mostly fission product gases, during their normal operation. They may release considerably more ra­ dioactivity during the course of an accident. It is necessary to be able to calculate the doses to the public from such releases in order to evaluate the environmental impact of the normally operating plant, to ensure that this is within acceptable standards, and to ascertain the radiological consequences of reactor accidents. Such computations also play an important role in determining the acceptability of a proposed reactor site. Before dose calculations can be carried out, however, it is necessary to deter­ mine how the concentration of the radioactive effluent varies from point to point following its emission into the atmosphere. This question is considered in this sec­ tion. Dose calculations are discussed in Section 11.5. Meteorology of Dispersion Consider a volume of air of thickness dz and cross-sectional area A that is in equi­ librium (motionless) at the altitude z as shown in Fig. 11.5. The volume is sup­ ported in place by the pressure difference between the top and bottom. Balancing forces on the volume means that [P(z) -P(z + dz)]A = pgA dz, (11.1) where p is the air density within the volume and g is the acceleration of gravity. Simplifying Eq. (11.1) by taking the limit as dz tends to zero gives dP --=pg. dz (11.2) To a good approximation, air may be taken to be an ideal gas, in which case the ideal gas law P(z + dz) +�l P (z) Ground level Figure 11.5 Differential volume of air in equilibrium in the atmosphere.

 text: 632 Reactor Licensing Chap. 11 (11.3) where n M is the number of moles of gas in V and R is the gas constant, is valid. Dividing Eq. (11.3) by V and noting the n M / V is proportional to the density of the gas then gives P = constant x p T (11.4) Air is not a good conductor. Furthermore, the normal motions of volumes of air within the atmosphere are so rapid that there is little exchange of heat from one volume to another. As a consequence, it is possible to assume that atmospheric motions are adiabatic. This, in tum, means that as the pressure changes, the tem­ perature varies according to T = constant x p(Y-l)/Y (11.5) where y is the usual ratio of the specific heats at constant pressure and constant volume. When p and P are eliminated from Eq. (11.2) using Eqs. (11.4) and (11.5), the following simple equation results: dT --=c. dz Here C is a constant. The solution to this equation is T = To -Cz, (11.6) where To is the temperature at z = 0, ground level. It will be observed from Eq. (11.6) that T decreases linearly with increasing altitude. For this reason, T, which in Eqs. (11.3) and (11.5) has to be given on an absolute scale, can be expressed in either °C or of in Eq. (11.6). The constant C is equal to the rate of change in temperature per unit altitude and is called the adiabatic lapse rate. This lapse rate is about 5.4°FIl ,000 ft, or 1 °CIl 00 m. In the absence of vertical heat transfer, an atmosphere that is well mixed exhibits an adiabatic lapse rate. However, atmospheric conditions are continually changing, and, as a result, the temperature distribution in the atmosphere frequently differs substantially from adiabatic. For example, over certain ranges in altitude, the rate of temperature decrease may be more rapid than the adiabatic rate, and, in this case, the stratum of air is said to exhibit superadiabatic behavior. On the other hand, the rate of temperature decrease may be less rapid than the adiabatic rate, and the stratum, for reasons explained later, is said to be stable. An important situation of this kind occurs when the temperature increases over some range in altitude, a condition called an inversion, or when the temperature remains constant across a

Examples of these temperature distri­ butions are illustrated in Fig. 11.6. The actual temperature profile of the atmosphere at any time is determined by a number of factors, including the heating and cooling of the earth's surface, the movement of large air masses, the existence of cloud cover, and the presence of local topographic obstacles. The earth is heated by the sun during the daytime, but at night, in the absence of sunshine, it cools down as it radiates energy. On clear days and with light winds, superadiabatic conditions may occur in the first few hundreds of meters of the atmosphere, due to the heat transferred to the air from the hot surface of the earth. On the other hand, on a cloudless night, when the earth radiates energy most easily, the earth's surface may cool down faster than the air immediately above it, and the result is a radiation inversion. This diurnal variation of the temperature profile of the atmosphere up to 450 m is shown in Fig. 11.7. The shifting from superadiabatic to inversion conditions and back again is plainly evident in the figure. As is commonly shown on a weather map, regions of the atmosphere with identifiable characteri stics occur throughout the world. Regions that are at higher pressure than the surrounding atmosphere are called highs; those at lower pressure are called lows. Most of the variations in weather and the local temperature profiles of the atmosphere are associated with the existence or movements of these highs and lows. Consider a column of air as it sinks within the atmosphere as shown in Fig. 11.8. When the column falls to lower altitudes, it is heated adiabatically as its pres-

However, in a given interval of time, the top of the column moves a greater distance downwa rd than the bottom of the column, since the latter is con­ strained by the presence of the earth's surface to move laterally. As a result, if the air falls far enough, the top of the column may reach a higher temperature than the bottom. This condition is known as a subsidence inversion. These types of inver­ sions are found within the large high-pressure areas, characteristic of fair weather, that continually move across the North American and Asian continents. They also occur along the edges of oceanic stationary highs found at lower latitudes. The degree to which pollutants are dispersed in the atmosphere depends to a large extent on the atmospheric temperature profile. Consider first the case of dispersion in a superadiabatic atmosphere. If a small volume of polluted air (called a parcel of air by meteorologists, since its volume generally changes after release) is released at some altitude h and at the same temperature Ta as the atmosphere, as indicated in Fig. 11.9(a), then according to the derivation of Eq. (11.6), the parcel will remain in static equilibrium at that point if not disturbed. Suppose, however, that a fluctuation in the atmosphere moves the parcel upward. The parcel will cool as it rises, but adiabatically; that is, the temperature of the parcel will follow the adiabatic curve, shown by dashed lines in the figure. It is clear from the figure that although the temperature of the parcel decreases in absolute terms, the parcel, as it rises, becomes increasingly hotter than the surrounding superadiabatic atmosphere. In tum, this means that the parcel becomes increasingly buoyant, causing it to move more rapidly upward, away from its point of release. On the other hand, if the parcel is initially pushed downward, its temperature will fall more rapidly than that of the surrounding atmosphere, and the air will become increasingly dense, which will accelerate the motion of the parcel downward. It is clear that superadiabatic temperature conditions are inherently unstable and are highly favorable for the dispersing of pollutants. z h (a) Super­ adiabatic z h T \� Adiabatic \ \ \ \ \ '\ Inversion (b) Figure 11.9 Movement of a parcel of air in (a) a superadiabatic profile and (b) an inversion profile. T

page number: 654
 text: 636 Reactor Licensing Chap. 11 By contrast, suppose the parcel is released into an inversion profile as shown in Fig. 11.9(b). If a fluctuation moves the parcel upward, its temperature falls more rapidly than that of the atmosphere, the parcel becomes denser, its upward motion stops, and it returns to its release point. If the parcel is moved downward, its tem­ perature increases above that of the atmosphere, the parcel becomes more buoyant, and it again returns to the release point. The atmosphere in this case is said to be stable, obviously not a desirable state of affairs for pollutant dispersion. This same argument also applies for releases into an isothennal profile. Finally, if a parcel is released in an adiabatic profile, its movements are not accompanied by changes in its relative buoyancy. The parcel simply moves a short distance up or down the adiabatic, subject to whatever local fluctuations occur in the atmosphere. For this reason, an adiabatic profile is referred to as neutral. In the preceding discussion, it was assumed that the parcel of air was released at the same temperature as the atmosphere. If, as is frequently the case, the parcel is hotter than its surroundings, the parcel will immediately rise, due to its greater buoyancy. With unstable or neutral conditions, the parcel rises a distance D..h until it has mixed with and achieved temperature equilibrium with the atmosphere. From this point on, it disperses in a manner to be discussed later in this section. On the other hand, when a hot parcel is released in stable air, it rises until it reaches the inversion and then fans out as described next. The distance D..h is called plume rise. A number of fonnulas, too complex to be reproduced here, have been given in the literature to estimate D..h. In any case, if plume rise is ignored in calculations of dispersion, the concentration of an effluent at ground level is overestimated, which results in conservative (higher than actual) estimates of radiation doses. Plume Formation The column or cloud of smoke emanating from the mouth of a continuously emitting chimney or smoke stack is called a plume. Ra­ dioactive effluents emitted from nuclear power installations behave in essentially the same way as ordinary smoke, except, of course, they are invisible to the naked eye. Figure 11.10 shows typical plumes emitted under the different temperature conditions given on the left. These plumes are classified as follows: Fanning When the effluent, which may be hot, is released in an inversion, it rises to the stable temperature, as previously explained, and remains there. If there is some wind blowing, the result is a thin trail of smoke at fixed altitude lead­ ing from the stack. If strong fluctuating horizontal wind components are present, the plume spreads out in the horizontal plane like a fan-hence the tennfanning. In the absence of strong fluctuations, the plume becomes a long, meandering ribbon of�moke.

The dashed curves in the left-hand column of diagrams show the adiabatic lapse rate, while the solid lines are the actual profiles. (From D. H. Salde, Editor, Meteorology and Atomic Energy-1968. Washington, D.C.: US Atomic Energy Commission, 1968.) A fanning plume is not necessarily an unfavorab le condition for the disper­ sion of effluents. For one thing, such a plume does not touch the ground. However, if the plume is blocked in any way, the effluents necessarily remain in the area. This is the case in the Los Angeles region, which is surrounded by mountains to the north and east and which lies under the subsidence inversion from the station­ ary Pacific High. This combination of circumstances accounts for the persistence of smog in that region. Fumigation Shortly after the sun rises on a clear morning, the inversion due to the nighttime radiating of the earth begins to dissipate as the surface of the earth heats up. Starting at ground level, the inversion is replaced by an adiabatic profile that moves slowly upward. (See Fig. 11.7.) Effluents emitted after the new profile has reached the top of the stack are confined by the inversion overhead, but can be dispersed toward the ground as the result of turbulence developed in the

page number: 656
 text: 638 Reactor Licensing Chap. 11 newly heated air. Such fumigation conditions can lead to a high concentration of effluents at ground level. looping If unstable conditions exist, as explained earlier, air moving up­ ward or downward continues to do so. Fluctuations in the vertical component of the wind, however, may cause upward moving air to tum downward, and vice versa. As a result, the plume exhibits a random behavior, and some of the plume may even touch the ground, as shown in Fig. 11.10. However, there is usually cons iderable turbulence under unstable condition s, and the concentration of effluents at ground level is generally less than under fumigation conditions. Coning This type of plume resembles a cone with a horizontal axis. It occurs with an adiabatic temperature profile and on windy days with turbulence providing the radial dispersion away from the axis. The plume normally touches the ground at a much greater distance than in looping or fumigation conditions. lofting The conditions under which lofting occurs develop around sunset, as the nighttime radiation inversion begins to build up. These are the most favorable conditions for the dispersion of effluents, for they are kept away from the ground and are dispersed at great distances over large volumes of air. Diffusion of Effluents An effluent released at some point into the atmosphere not only moves in a gross way, due to the various temperature conditions just discussed, but individual parti­ cles in the effluent become increasingly separated from one another as the result of local atmospheric turbulence. This process is called turbulent diffusion. This type of diffusion is fundamental ly different from the diffusion of a solute in a solvent or ordinary neutron diffusion, despite the fact that they are all described by essentially the same equations. Thus, the latter types of diffusion result from the successive collisions of individual particles, while the diffusion of pollutants is due to the cumulative effects of turbulent eddies in the atmosphere. Let X be the concentration of some effluent as a function of space and time. If the atmosphere is isotropic and at rest, then X is determined by the usual diffusion equation (see Eq. 5.16) 2 dx KV X =-, dt (11.7) where K is the diffusion coefficient. For the more usual case of a nonisotropic atmosphere, the diffusion equation is d2X d2X d2X dX Kx dx2 + Ky dy2 + Kz dz2 = dr· (11.8)

page number: 657
 text: Sec. 11.4 Dispersion of Effluents 639 With a wind blowing at an average speed v in the x-direction, the diffusion equation must be altered to account for the fact that the entire medium in which the diffusion is taking place is in motion. The equation then becomes 4 d2X d2X d2X dX _dX KX --2 +K --+Kz--=-+v-. dx y dy2 dz2 dt dx (11.9) Consider now a point source located at the origin of coordinates emitting effluent at the constant rate of Q' units per unit of time. The concentration X is then not a function of time. Further, it has been found experimentally that most of the movement of an effluent in the direction of the wind is due to the wind itself and not to diffusion. Thus, diffusion in the x-direction can be ignored, which can be accomplished by placing Kx equal to zero. Equation (11.9) then reduces to d2X d2X _dX KY-2 + KZ-2 = v-. (11.10) dy dz dx The solution to Eq. (11.10) that satisfies all the usual boundary conditions can be shown to be5 Q' [v (y2 Z2 )] X = 4rrxy'KyKz exp -4x Ky + Kz (1l.11) According to Eq. (11.11), the effluent moving along the x -direction spreads out in Gaussian distributions in the y-and z-directions. The standard deviati ons of these distributions are given by O'y = (2X:Y y/2 O'z (2xvKz y/2 (11.12) For purposes of matching Eq. (11.11) with experimental data, it is convenient to write the equation in terms of ay and az, which, it will be noted, are functions of x. Thus, Eq. (11.11) becomes Q' [( y2 Z2 )] X= exp --+-2rrvayaz 2a; 2az2 (11.13) In the present context, ay and az are called, respectively, the horizontal and vertical dispersion coefficients. Up to this point, it has been assumed that the effluents are emitted at the ori­ gin of coordinates into an infinite atmosphere. In fact, they are generally emitted 4See, for example, P. M. Morse and H. Feshbach, Methods of Theoretical Physics, Burr Ridge: McGraw-Hill, 1953, p.153. 5See, for instance, LaMarsh's Nuclear Reactor Theory, op. cit., p. 192. Equation (11.10) is identical in form to the Fermi age equation describing the slowing down of fast neutrons.

With z at the vertical coordinate, this solution IS Q' { [( y2 (z + h)2)] X = exp --+---2nvayaz 2a; 2a; From this result, the concentration at ground level, z = 0, is (11.14) (11.15) The value of X is largest along the centerline of the plume (i.e., where y = 0). The concentration there is (11.16) Furthermore , because the exponential factor in Eq. (11.16) is never greater than unity, it follows that the effluent concentration at all points is always greater along the plume with a ground-level release (h = 0) than when the effluents are released at some altitude. In this case, Eq. (11.16) reduces to Q' (11.17) To assure conservative estimates (i.e., overestimates) of effluent concentration, it is normal practice to use Eq. (11.16) when the altitude of emissions is known and Eq. (11.17) when it is not. In many contexts, it is convenient to divide these equations by Q' The LHS of the equation, namely, X / Q', is then called the dilution factor. Occasionally, radioactivity is emitted from nuclear power plants in puffs, rather than at a constant rate. The effluent concentration at any point at ground level then rises in time to some maximum value and subsequently falls to zero as the puff passes. It will be shown in the next section that the total radiation dose from such a puff is proportional to the time integral of X over the passage of the puff that is, to XT, where XT = f X(t)dt. (11.18)

 text: Sec. 11.4 Dispersion of Effluents 641 Because the emission and dispersion of a pollutant are separate and distinct pro­ cesses, XT can be written as (11.19) Here, Q is the total amount of effluent released in the puff (i.e., the time interval of Q'). Pasquill conditions. According to Eq. (11.12), both ay and az should increase as v'x from the point of emission. In fact, experimental data show that ay and az increase much more rapidly with distance. This means that the diffusion model for atmospheric dispersion is not an exact description of the phenomenon. The time­ averaged distribution of effluents in the y-and z-directions, however, has been found to be approximately Gaussian. It has become standard practice, therefore, to use experimental values of ay and az in Eq. (11.13) or (11.16) to calculate effluent concentration. Naturally, these functions depend on atmospheric conditions. Thus, az, which relates to the dispersion in the vertical direction, can be expected to increase more rapidly with distance under unstable conditions than under stable condition s. Working from experimental data, Pasquill6 obtained a set of curves for ay and az for six different atmospheric conditions. These are given in Figs. 11.11 and 11.12. A seventh stability condition, type G, extremely stable, may be approxi­ mated by the following relations: 3 2 az(G) = Saz(F); ay(G) = 3ay(F). (11.20) As shown in the figures, the less stable conditions have higher values of both a y and az than stable conditions, at all distances from the source. It is possible to estimate the stability conditions in the lower atmosphere by simply measuring the temperature at two or more heights on a meteorologi­ cal tower. The slope of the temperature profile can then be computed by dividing the temperature difference � T by the difference in height �z of the measurements . The relationship between the Pasquill stability categories and the observed � T / �z is given in Table 11.2. In the United States, the NRC requires the temperature (as well as wind speed and direction) to be continually monit ored at two points, usually at 10m and 60 m, on a tower or mast near every operating nuclear plant. The Pasquill conditions can also be detennined by monitoring the fluctuations in the angle of a wind vane. On days when the atmosphere is unstable, a wind vane tends to fluctuate more widely than on days when the atmosphere is stable. The correlation between the standard deviation of the angle of the vane, ae, to 6 See the references at the end of this chapter.

Although instrumentation to measure a(J directly has been installed at a number of nuclear power plants, this method is generally considered to be less reliable-the interpretation of the data is more difficult-than the simple temperature measurements just described. Figure 11.13 shows the quantity Xv / Q' for effluent released at a height of 30 m (about 100 ft) under the various Pasquill conditions as computed from Eq. (11.16). It will be observed that Xv / Q' rises to a maximum value and then de­ creases more or less exponentially. With the more unstable conditions (A, B), the maximum of Xv / Q' occurs near the source point (within a few hundred meters) and then drops rapidly to very low values. On the other hand, under stable con­ ditions (E, F), the peak of Xv / Q' is located much further from the source. In the dispersion of effluents from nuclear power plants, the concentration of the effluent is usually higher in the more important, populated off-site regions under stable than under unstable conditions, and stable conditions are often assumed calculations of such effluent dispersion. The location of the maximum of the curves in Fig. 11.13 can be estimated by placing the derivative of Eq. (11.16) with respect to x equal to zero. However, because all of the dependence of X upon x is contained in ay and az, it is neces­ sary, before differentiati ng, to assume some functional relationship between these parameters. For simplicity, let where a is a constant. Taking the logarithms of both sides of Eq. (11.16) prior to differentiating gives h2 In X = -2 In az - -2 2 + In C, az

Example 11.1 Estimate the location of the maximum concentration of a nonradioactive effluent released at a height of 30 m under type-F conditions. Solution. From Eq. (11.21), az = h/h = 21.2 m. From Fig. 11.12, az has the value of 21.1 at about 1900 m (1.2 mi). [Ans.] Radioactive effluent If the effluent is radioactive, some of the activity in the plume may decay as it is dispersed in the atmosphere. This may be taken into account by replacing Q' in Eq. (11.16) by Q� exp (-At), where Q� is the rate of emission of the radioactivity from the source, A is the decay constant, and t is the time required for the effluent to reach the point of observation. Assuming that the effluent moves only with the wind in the x-direction and does not meander, we see that t is equal to X/v. Then, Eq. (11.16) becomes (11.23) This equation obviously overestimates the value of X at x. Deposition and Fallout The amount of radioactivity in an effluent plume may also decrease with distance from the source as some of the radioactivity falls out or diffuses out of the plume and deposits on the ground. This effect is most pronounced for some types of radionuclides, in particular, the isotopes of iodine, during periods of rain. Water droplets tend to pick up the radioactivity and carry it directly to the ground, a pro­ cess known as washout, or wet deposition. Once radioactivity is deposited on the ground, it may provide a significant source of radiation exposure. Furthermore, ra­ dioactivity falling on food stuffs, pasture land, or bodies of water may enter into the human food chain. The mathematical description of wet deposition is qualitatively similar to that for ordinary, or dry, deposition, although the underlying phenomena are fundamen­ tally different. Thus, for both, the deposition rate per unit area of the ground is taken

If Rd has the units of Ci/m2-sec and X is in Ci/m3, then Vd has the units of m1sec and is called the deposition velocity. In Eq. (11.24), X is evaluated at or near ground level, and the value of Vd is obtained from experiment. The dry-deposition velocity for iodine ranges from about 0.002 to 0.01 m1sec; it is somewhat smaller for particulate fallout. The value of Vd for wet deposition depends on the height of the plume (z in the calculations presented next). For a nominal height of 103 m, Vd is approximately 0.2 m1sec for iodine and 0.1 m1sec for particulates. The noble gases are not subject to either dry or wet deposition. Consider now the concentration of an effluent subject to deposition as a func­ tion of distance from the source. Along the centerline of the plume, X will be a function of only x and z. The total amount of effluent (radioactivity) in a volume element of the plume of unit width in the y-direction and thickness dx is given by the integral dx 1: x(x, z)dz. The rate at which this ef fluent decreases due to deposition is then d 100 -dx x(x, z) dz = -x(x, O)vddx. dt z=o (11.25) Noting that dx / dt = V, we find that the average wind speed, Eq. (11.25), can be written as d 100 ( ) d __ x(x, O)vddx X x, z z - _ . o v Next, define z by the relation 1 roo z= x(x,O)}o x(x,z)dz. (11.26) (11.27) This parameter is called the effective height of the plume. It is easy to show that if x(x, z) is given by Eq. (11.14), then z = /'faz exp(h2/2az2). (11.28) Introducing z into Eq. (11.26) gives d X (x, 0) = -A X (x, 0) dx, (11.29)

At much larger distances, however, diffusion theory cannot be expected to be valid. Fluctuations in atmospheric conditions tend to disperse an effluent at long distances in an unpredictable way. While the anticipated radiation dose to an in­ dividual loca ted far from a nuclear plant is usually negligible, even after a major accident, the total population dose (man-rems or people-sie verts) may be signif­ icant. For calculations of population doses a simple method, the wedge model of atmospheric dispersion, is often used. Consider a source emitting effluent at the rate of Q' units per time. The as­ sumption underlying the wedge model is that the effluent concentration becomes unifonn within a wedge of angle e and height a as indicated in Fig. 11.14. In the absence of radioactive decay or deposition on the ground, all of the effluent emit­ ted in the time dt, namely, Q'dt, eventually appears in the volume element dV between rand r + dr, where T a 1 dV = aredr. , , " " " " " " " '-,--- " -----\'::' -� --, " ' - () \�\: r_--If--dr Figure 11.14 Diagram for calculating the wedge model.

Releases from Buildings 649 (11.32) (11.33) In a reactor accident, radionuclides may be released into the containment structure, which may then leak at one or more points. If a wind is blowing, the presence of the structure creates a wake of turbulent eddies on the down-wind side of the building. This, in tum, tends to disperse the effluents immediately upon their release from the building. The effect of this initial dispersion can be included in the preceding fonnula in the following way. First, the building dilution factor is defined as DB = cAv, (11.34) where c is an empirical constant, sometimes called the shape factor; A is the cross­ sectional area of the building; and v is the average wind speed. Note that DB has units of m3 -sec-l Experiments show that c has a value of between 0.50 and 0.67. The dispersion coefficients ay and az are then replaced in all of the fonnulas de­ rived earlier by the parameter �y and �z' which are defined by the relations: 2 2 DB 2 2 DB �y = ay + --, �z = az + --. JrV JrV Thus, for example, Eq. (11.16) becomes (11.35) (11.36)

page number: 668
 text: 650 Reactor Licensing Chap. 11 This equation is applicable to releases near or at ground level, and to be conserva­ tive, h is often placed equal to zero. Another essentially equivalent formula that is often used to compute X from ground-level releases from buildings is Q' X= ----­nvuyuZ + DB (11.37) In the immediate vicinity of a leaking structure, both u y and uz are equal to zero, for the effluent at this point has not begun to form a plume. In this case, both Eq. (11.36), with h = 0, and Eq. (11.37) reduce to Q' X=-· DB (11.38) This formula can also be used to compute the concentration of radionuclide in the neighborhood of an exhaust vent. If the concentration of the radionuclide in the vent is Xo Cilm3 and the vent exhausts at the rate of V m3/sec, then Q' = V Xo, and Eq. (11.38) gives x = (:Jxo. (11.39) 11.5 RADIATION DOSES FROM NUCLEAR PLANTS Nuclear plants may give rise to a number of sources of radiation exposure to per­ sons residing in their vicinity. From their gaseous radioactive effluent, there is: (1) an external dose from radiation emitted from the plume; (2) an internal dose from the inhalation of radionuclides; (3) an external dose from radiation emitted by radionuclides deposited on the ground; and (4) an external dose from radionu­ clides deposited on the body and clothing. The last of these doses is highly variable and will not be considered here. Radiation doses may also be received from the ingestion of foodstuffs con­ taminated by gaseous or liquid effluents from a nuclear plant. The calculation of these doses is covered in Section 11.9. Finally, there is a direct dose from y -rays emitted from within the plant. In a normally operating plant, these may emanate from the reactor itself, from coolant piping, or from other components of the plant containing radioactivity. Follow­ ing a reactor accident in which fission products are released into the containment building, the building becomes a source of direct radiation dose.

 text: Sec. 11.5 Radiation Doses from Nuclear Plants 651 External Dose from Plume: ,-Rays In making calculations of external doses, it is usual to assume that the plume is in­ finitely large. This assumption simplifies the computations and gives conservative answers; that is, it gives doses that are larger than they actually are. Consider an infinite uniform cloud located above ground level, containing a single radionuclide at a concentration of X Ci/cm3, emitting a single y-ray of energy E MeV. According to Eq. (9.20) and the discussion in Section 10.1, the exposure rate is 01.40) where ¢Jyb is the y-ray buildup flux. To compute ¢Jyb, let dV be a small volume element in a hemispherical shell of radius r and thickness dr centered at the point P as shown in Fig. 11.15. If S y-rays are emitted per cm3/sec, the buildup flux at P from dV is _ S dV -w d¢Jyb -4rrr2 Bp(p.,r)e where B p (p.,r) is the point buildup factor for the air. The total flux from all elements d V in the shell is then and ¢Jyb is given by S d¢Jyb = --2 X 2rrr2 dr x Bp(p.,r)e-W 4rrr S = 2,Bp(p.,r)e-W dr, _ S 100 -/-lr ¢Jyb --Bp(p.,r)e dr. 2 0 01.41) 01.42) The value of the integral in Eq. 01.42) is independent of the form of Bp(p.,r), as can be seen by the next argument. Suppose that a point source emits S y-rays/sec dr V Figure 11.15 Hemispherical shell P Ground level in a cloud.

The buildup flux at the distance r is then _ S -w <Pyb -4nr2 Bp(/Lr)e (11.43) The energy absorbed out of this flux in a spherical shell of thickness dr at r is S/LaE 2 <Pyb/LaE dV = --2 x Bp(/Lr)e-W x 4nr dr 4nr = S/LaEBp(/Lr)e-W dr, where /La is the absorption coefficient of air. Since the atmosphere is infinite, all of the energy emitted by the source per second, namely, SE, must be absorbed somewhere. It follows that SE = 100 tPyblLaE dV Introducing <Pyb from Eq. (11.43) gives 1 = /La 100 Bp(w)e-W dr. (11.44) In view of Eq. (11.44), Eq. (11.42), giving the buildup flux at the center of the cloud becomes S <Pyb = -. 2/La (11.45) With a radionuclide concentration in the cloud of X Ci/cm3, S is equal to 3.7 x 1010 X, provided that there is only one y -ray emitted per disintegration. Introducing these results into Eq. (11.40) yields • 8 3.7 X 1010 X (/La )air X = 1.83 x 10-x X E - 2/La P = 2.62 X 105 X E R/sec, where p = 1.293 X 10-3 g/cm3 is used for the density of air. (11.46) If more than one y-ray is emitted by the nuclide, Eq. (11.46) should be written as x = 2.62 X 105 X Ey R/sec, (11.47) where Ey is the_average energy of all the y-rays per disintegration. Table 11.3 gives values of Ey for the most important of the fission product gases. These are

Equation (11.47) can also be derived in a less complicated way. At any point in an infinite unif orm cloud, as many y-rays must be absorbed in the steady state as are emitted per cm3/sec. For a radionuclide at a concentration of X Ci/cm3 emitting an average of By MeV per disintegrati on, the total amount of energy emitted is 3.7 x 1010XBg x 1.6 x 10-6 erg/cm3-sec. This energy is absorbed in air having a mass of 1.293 x 10-3 g/cm3, so that the energy absorption rate is 3.7xl01OXB X 1.6 x 10-6 - 1.293 : 10-3 = 4.58 x 107 X Ey erg/g-sec. From Eq. (9.19), the absorption of 87.5 erg/g gives an exposure of 1 R. Thus, the exposure rate in conventional units is . 4.58 X 107 X By - X = = 5.23 X 105 X Ey Rlsec. 87.5 (11.48) Because a person on the ground is exposed to only one-half of the cloud, it is necessary to mUltiply Eq. (11.48) by 0.5, which yields Eq. (11.47). In the preceding equations, X has units of Cilcm3 . If X is given in Ci/m3, as is frequently the case in view of the units of O'y and O'z in Eq. (11.16), then Eq. (11.47)

 text: 654 Reactor Licensing Chap. 11 becomes x = 0.262x By R/sec. (11.49) To obtain the dose equivalent (biological dose) rate in conventional units from the preceding equations, X must be multiplied by the f-factor from Fig. 9.10 and by the quality factor. Both of the factors are approximately unity, however, so that if ::: 0.262x By rem/sec, (11.50) where X is in Ci/m3 In SI units, this becomes if ::: 2.62x By Sv/sec. Example 11.2 A PWR power plant releases an average of 2 x 103 Ci of 133Xe per year from a vent 100 m above the ground. Calculate the external y-ray dose rate at a point 104 m from the plant under type F conditions and with a wind speed of 1 m/sec Solution. The average rate of emission of the 133Xe is 2 x 103/3.16 X 107 = 6.33 x 10-5 Cilsec. From Figures 11.11 and 11.12, a y = 275 m and az = 46 m. Then using Eq. (11.16) with h = 100 m gives 6.33 x 10-5 [ 104] X = exp -2 = 1.50 X 10-10 Ci/m3 7r x 1 x 275 x 46 2 x (46) Substituting this value and Eg = 0.030 MeV from Table 11.3 into Eq. (11.50) yields iI = 0.262 x 1.50 x 10-10 x 0.030 = 1.18 x 10-12 rem/sec = 0.0373 mrem/yr. [Ans.] In SI units, this is iI = 2.62 x 1.50 x 10-10 x 0.030 = 1.18 x 10-12 Sv/sec = 0.373 mSv/yr. [Ans.] According to Eq. (11.50), the dose rate from a given radionuclide is directly proportional to the concentration of the radionuclide in the plume. Thus, if can be written as where C y is a constant that depends only on the characteri stics of the nuclide, not on its concentrati on. The quantity Cy is called a dose-rate factor. Clearly, Cy is simply the dose rate from external exposure per unit density of radionuclide in

 text: Sec. 11.5 Radiation Doses from Nuclear Plants 655 the plume. This factor has been computed and tabulated for the most significant radionuclides. (See the references at the end of the chapter.) Example 11.3 Compute the dose-rate factor for external y-ray exposure to 85Kr. Solution. From Table 11.3, Ey = 0.00211 MeV, so that Cy = 0.262 x 0.00211 = 5.53 x 10-4 rems/sec per Cilm3.[Ans.] External Dose from Plume: ,a-Rays The external dose rate due to fJ-rays is usually computed in two steps. First, the absorbed dose rate is detennined in the air immediately outside the body. The dose within the surface layer of the body is then estimated on the basis of an empirical relation between the air and epidennal doses. The dose rate in air, Dair, can be found using the second method for comput­ ing X in the infinite cloud previously described. The only difference is that Dair is given in rads/sec and X is in R1sec. Because one rad corresponds to the absorption of 100 ergs/g, while one roentgen corresponds to only 87.5 ergs/g, it follows that . 87.5 -Dair = -- x 0.262XEf3 100 = 0.229X Ef3 rad/sec, (11.51) where X is in Cilm3 and Ef3 is the average energy of the emitted fJ-rays in MeV. The dose equivalent rate in tissue is then given by iI = 0.229 X jj; f3 x f (d, Emax) rem/sec, (11.52) where f is an experimentally determined function of d, distance into the tissue, and Emax, the maximum energy of the emitted fJ-rays. The dose rate is largest at the surface of the skin, where f 1, and decreases rapidly with distance into the tissue. To be conservative, therefore, the skin dose is usually computed with f = 1.7 The dose-rate factor for fJ-rays is then (11.53) 7por external exposure, the NRC frequently calculates whole-body y-ray doses at a depth of 5 cm into the body and skin doses at a depth of 7 mg/cm2 The 5 cm corresponds to the average depth of the blood-forming organs; 7 mg/cm2 is the depth of the epidermal basal cells, the living cells in the skin.

 text: 656 Reactor Licensing Chap. 11 Example 11.4 What is the yearly external f3-ray dose rate from 133Xe under the conditions of Example 11.2? Solution. From Table 11.3, Ef3 = 0.146 MeV. Then, using X = 1.50 x 10-IOCi/m3 in Eq. (11.52) with f = 1 gives if = 0.229 x 1.50 x 10-10 x 0.146 = 5.02 x 10-12 rern/sec = 0.158 mrern/yr. [Ans.] The total y-ray or fJ-ray dose received over a period of to sec is obtained by integrating Eq. (11.50) or Eq. (11.52) from zero to to. In the case where X is constant, the total dose is simply if multiplied by to. On the other hand, if X decreases with the half-life of the radionuclide, X = xoe-A1 then the total dose is H = 1'0 H(t)dt = �o (1 _ e-Ato), (11.54) where ifo is the initial dose rate in the concentration Xo. When to is long compared with the half-life of the nuclide, Eq. (11.54) reduces to and Ho . H = T = 1.44HoTl/2. For a puff of effluent, the total y-ray and fJ-ray doses are given by H = 0.262XT Eyrem H = 0.229 XT E ,srem, where XT is defined in Eq. (11.19). Internal Dose from Inhalation (11.55) (11.56) (11.57) It is common knowledge that a person's breathing rate (i.e., intake of air) is a func­ tion of the activity in which he is engaged. Thus, the average breathing rate during an 8-hr working day for a standard man (as defined by the ICRP) is taken to be

 text: Sec. 11.5 Radiation Doses from Nuclear Plants 657 (11.58) while the average for a full 24-hr day is B = 20 m3/24 hr = 2.32 x 10-4 m3/sec. (11.59) For short periods, a person may breathe more rapidly (especially if he has reason to think that he is in a radiation field), and breathing rates as high as 5 x 10-4 m3/sec are used in some reactor safety calculation s. In computing internal doses, it will be recalled from Chapter 9 that a radionu­ clide introduced into the body does not contribute to the dose until some time later, when, provided that it has been retained by the body, the radionuclide ultimately decays. Consider first the problem of detennining the dose rate received by a par­ ticular body organ at the end of a period of inhalation of duration to. During the time drat r, the amount B X (r) d r Ci of radionuclide is inhaled. The activity remaining in the organ at the time to is Bx(r)R(to -r)e-A(to-r)dr, where R(to -r) is the retention function, discussed in Sec. 9.9, for the organ in question. The total activity in the organ as the result of inhalation from r = 0 to r = to is then B 1'0 X (r)R(to -r)e-J.(lo-T)dr. This activity gives a dose rate at to of H = --- X (r)R(to -r)e-A(to-r) dr rem/sec. . 592B� lto M 0 The usual retention function is given by Eq. (9.36), namely, R(to -r) = Coqe-Ab(to-r), (11.60) where q is the fraction of the radionuclide that goes to the particular organ and Ab is the decay constant for biological clearance from that organ. Introducing R(to -r) into Eq. (11.60) gives where . 592B�q (to H = M 10 x (r)e-Ae(to-r) dr rem/sec, is the effective decay constant of the radionuclide in the organ. (11.61) (11.62)

(11.61) can be inte­ grated directly, giving . 592�qX H = (1 -e-AetO) rem/sec MAe ' or, in SI units of Sv/sec, if = 5920�q X (1 _ e-AetO) Sv/sec. MAe (11.63) When the duration of the inhalation is greater than either TI/2 or TI/2b, the expo­ nential in Eq. (11.63) becomes very small. The dose rate then reduces to . 592B�qX H = rem/sec. MAe (11.64) This formula gives the steady-state, equilibrium dose rate for persons continually inhaling a radionuclide at the concentration x. The dose-rate factor for inhalation is given by the combination of parameters multiplying X in either Eq. (11.63) or Eq. (11.64). Example 11.5 A BWR plant emits an average of 1.23 Ci of 131 I per year from a vent 30 m above ground level. Assuming type-E stability conditions and an average wind speed of 1.2 m/sec, calculate (a) the equilibrium dose to an adult thyroid at a point on the ground 2,000 m from the plant; (b) the annual dose to the thyroid at this point. [Note: For 1311, TI/2 = 8.04 days, TI/2b = 138 days, � = 0.23 MeV8, and q = 0.23. The mass of an adult thyroid is 20 g.9] Solution. 1. A release rate of 1.23 Ci/year is equal to 1.23/3.16 x 107 = 3.89 X 10-8 Ci/sec. From Fig. 11.13, xv/Q' = 6.0 x 10-5/m2 at 2,000 m for type-E conditions. Thus, 6.0 X 10-5 x 3.89 X 10-8 -12 Ci/ 3 X = = 1.95 x 10 m 1.2 Using the nonnal breathing rate from Eq. (11.59) gives Cd = 1.95 X 10-12 x 2.32 X 10-4 = 4.52 X 10-16 Ci/sec. 8The values of � for the other isotopes of iodine are given in Table 11.17 and Problem 11.17. 9The mass of an infant (one-year old) thyroid is generally taken to be 2 g. Thus, the dose rate and dose commitment to the infant thyroid is 10 times that to the adult thyroid.

[Ans.] This problem can also be solved by comparing the concentration of 131 I at the point inhaled with the (MPC)a for 131 I and its corresponding annual dose. Thus, in ICRP Publication 2 (see the references in Chapter 9), the (MPC)a of 131 I for occu­ pational exposure is given as 3 x 10-9 /LCi/cm3 = 3 x 10-9 Ci/m3 for continuous inhalation at a rate of 20 m3124 hr. This was computed from an annual thyroid dose of 30 rems. It follows that the continuous inhalation of air with 131 I at the concentration X would give a yearly dose of H = X x 30 rem. 3 x 10-9 Using the value X = 1.95 X 10-12 Ci/m3 of this example yields 1.95 x 10-12 H = ----- x 30 x 19.5 mrem, 3 x 10-9 which is essentially the same answer as obtained earlier. Consider next the total future dose, or dose commitment, that is received by a body organ subsequent to the inhalation of B X (r) d r Ci in the time dr.

(11.65) or (11.66), this is C -592�q (11.67) dc -MAe· These factors have also been tabulated for various body organs and most radionu­ clides. (See references.) It should be noted from Eq. (11.66) that the dose commitment from the in­ halation (the same is true for ingestion) of radionuclides depends only on the total amount of radionuclides taken into the body and is independent of the time interval over which the inhalation occurs. One curie inhaled in one second ultimately gives the same dose as one curie inhaled over a period of a year. 10 Dose from Ground-Deposited Radionucl ides Significa nt doses may be received from radionuclides deposited on the ground from the plume following a major, although improbable, nuclear plant accident. Thus, it has been estimated that, in the absence of evacuation, approximately 80% of the total dose received by the public in a core meltdown accident with breech of containment would be due to I37CS (TI/2 = 30.17 years) that escapes from the IOThe NRC computes dose-commitment factors over a period of 50 years, rather than for an infinite time, beginning with the onset of a one-year intake of the radionuclide. This leads to slightly smaller dose-commitment factors for nuclides with long radiological and biological lives than factors computed from Eq. 01.65). Also, in calculations of dose-commitment factors for an infant or child, it is necessary to account for changing organ size and breathing rate as the individual grows.

In calculations of doses from ground­ deposited radionuc1ides, it is usual to consider only the y-ray dose. The fJ-rays are frequently ignored, since these provide only a skin dose, which, in any case, is normally much smaller than the corresponding y-ray dose. Consider then an infinite planar surface containing radionuc1ides at a density of S Ci/m2 emitting one y-ray of energy E MeV per disintegration.

Dose-rate conversion factors (i.e., the quan­ tity multiplying S in Eq. 01.71)), are tabulated in the references at the end of the chapter. Example 11.6 Calculate the y-ray dose-rate conversion factor for ground exposure for 137CS at a height of 1 m.

Leakage from Buildings In reactor accidents, radionuclides, especially fission product gases, are first re­ leased into the containment building and subsequently may leak to the atmosphere.

page number: 681
 text: Sec. 11.5 Radiation Doses from Nuclear Pla nts 663 Among other things, the magnitude of the resulting plume depends on the rate at which this leakage occurs. The leakage rate from a building is specified as a percentage of the gas in the building that leaks out per day. A reasonably tight reactor building, for example, will leak less than 0.1 % per day of its contained gases. Now suppose that in an accident Co units of some stable fission product are released into the building, and let C be the amount of the nuclide remaining in the building at time t. Then, C is detennined by the equation dC - = -O.OlpC, dt (11.73) where p is the leakage rate in percent. Equation (11.73) is the same as the equation for radioactive decay with the decay constant Al = O.Olp. The solution to Eq. (11.73) can then be written as If, as is the usual case, the fission product is radioactive, then C = Coe-(A+A[)t (11.74) (11.75) (11.76) where A is the radioactive decay constant and C and Co are in appropriate units of radioactivity. Because Al is equivalent to a decay constant, the rate at which the fission product is released from the building is Q' = AIC = AICoe-Act (11.77) where (11.78) is the total decay constant of the fission product in the building. Equation (11.77) is the source term in the dispersion relations derived in Sec. 11.4. For example, with ground level release, Eq. (11.16) gives x =---- 1TVO'yO'z (11.79) where deposition from the plume and building wake effects have been ignored.

This is simply because such a calculation would be of little value, as the organ is destined to receive its full dose commitment in any case, beyond to, barring death or surgery. Example 11.7 In an accident in a 1,000-MW reactor, 6.25 x 106 Ci of 1351 (25% of its equilibrium activity) is released into the containment building, which leaks at the rate of 0.1 % per day. Calculate the following doses for a person during the first 2 hrs after the accident who is standing at a distance of 2,000 m from the reactor building. 131 I is assumed to be released at ground level, under type F dispersion conditions and with a wind speed of 1 mlsec: (a) the total external y-ray dose; (b) the dose rate to the thyroid at the end of the 2 hrs; (c) the dose commitment to the thyroid. Solution. 1. From Eq. (11.74), Al = 0.01 x 0.1 = 10-3 day- = 10-3/86,400 = 1.16 X 10-8 sec- From Example 11.5, the radioactive decay constant is 9.98 x 10-7 sec-1 Using Eq. (11.78), we see that Ac = 9.98 X 10-7 + 1.16 X 10-8 = 1.00 X 10-6 sec- Then, Acto = 1.00 x 10-6 X 2 x 3,600 = 7.2 x 10-3 which is « 1, so that Eq. (11.81) applies.

Equation (11.84) applies in this case. Using the foregoing values and data from Example 11.5 yields

[Ans.] 3. The dose commitment is given by Eq. (11.87), and it will be observed that this is simply the dose rate at 2 hrs divided by Ae. From Example 11.5, Ae = 1.06 X 10-6 sec-I, so that 4.11 x 10-5 H = 1.06 X 10-6 = 38.8 rem. [Ans.] This example shows that 131 I gives a negligible whole-body y-ray dose. The dose commitment to the thyroid, however, is already substantial at only 2 hrs. Direct ,-Ray Dose The exposure rate from the y-rays emitted from within the reactor building can be approximated by taking the building to be a point source. Then, if shielding by the building is ignored, the exposure rate is given by Eq. (11.40) with the buildup flux SBp(f.Lr)e-W ¢yb = 4 2 ' (11.88) rrr where S is the number of y-rays emitted per second and Bp(f.Lr) is the point buildup factor for air. (See problem 11.9.) Introducing Eq. (11.88) into Eq. (11.40) gives ( ) air B ( ) -/-Lr X = 1.46 X 10-9 SE:a p f.L;2 e R/sec. As earlier, iI ::: X. (11.89) If the direct dose originates with y-rays emitted by radionuclides released into the building in an accident, then the factor S in Eq. (11.89) is given by (11.90) where Co is the total number of curies released, Ac is the decay constant including leakage (see Eq. (11.78», and t is the time after the accident. The total direct dose received up to the time to is obtained by substituting Eq. (11.90) into Eq. (11.89) and integrating from t = 0 to t = to. The result is 54.0Co _).. t (f.La ) air B p (f.Lr )e-W H ::: X = (1 -e cO) E - rem. Ac P r2 (11.91) In this fonnula, Co is in Ci, Ac is in sec-I, to is in sec, f.L is in cm-1, r is in cm, E is in MeV, and (f.La/ p)air is in cm2/g.

 text: Sec. 11.5 Radiation Doses from Nuclear Plants 667 Shielding by the reactor building may be included by using the appropriate prescription from Chapter 10. For example, if the building is concrete and a cm thick, then Eqs. (11.89) and (11.91) must be multiplied by the factor B pc (J1,ca)e -/1-ea where B pc (J1,ca) is the buildup factor for concrete calculated using parameters given in Table 10.3. Example 11.8 The fission product gas 88Kr (T1/2 = 2.79 hr) emits several y-rays, the most promi­ nent of which has an energy of 2040 MeV and is emitted in about 40% of the disin­ tegrations. In an accident, 3 x 107 Ci of 88Kr are released into a reactor building that leaks at a rate of 0.1 %/day. Calculate the direct 2-hr dose from the 2040-Me V y -ray at a distance of 1,000 m from the building. Solution. The effective number of curies in which the y-ray is emitted is Co = 3 X 107 x 0040 = 1.2 x 107Ci. The decay constant for 88Kr is A = 0.693/2.79 x 3600 = 6.90 x 10-5 sec-1 From Example 11.7, Al = 1.16 X 10-8 sec-I, so that from Eq. (11.78), Ac = 6.90 X 10-5 + 1.16 X 10-8 ::::: 6.90 x 10-5 sec-I This shows that with such a short-lived nuclide, the decrease in the concentration in the building due to leakage can be ignored. From Table 1104 at 2040 MeV, j-t = 5.30 x 10-5cm-1 and j-tr = 5.3. Then, using problem 11.9, Bp(j-tr) = 4.7. Also from Table 11.5 (j-ta/ p)air = 0.0227 cm2/g. Substituting these values into Eq. (11.91) with to = 2 hr = 7,200 sec then yields 54.0 x 1.2 x 107 -5 4.7 x e-H = (1 -e-6.90x 10 X7,200) x 2040 x 0.0227 x ----6.90 X 10-5 (105)2 = 00468 rems. [Ans.] Population Doses Up to this point, only doses to individuals have been considered. However, to eval­ uate the overall effect on the surrounding population of routine or accidental re­ leases of radiation from a nuclear plant, it is also usual to compute the total popu­ lation dose. This is the sum of the doses to individuals multiplied by the number of persons receiving those doses. The units of population dose are olwieY-sly person rems. For example, if out of 1,000 people exposed to radiation, 500 receive 1 rem

page number: 686
 text: 668 Reactor Licen sing and the remainder receive 2 rems, the population dose is simply Hpop = 500 x 1 + 500 x 2 = 1,500 person-re ms. Chap. 11 To obtain a general formula for Hpop, it will first be recalled that the total dose to an individual at the distance r from a plant from external exposure to a plume, external exposure to radionuclides deposited on the ground, or radio nuclides that are inhaled, can be written as H(r) = CXT(r), (11.92) where C is an appropriate dose conversion factor and XT (r) is the time integral of the radionuclide concentration at r over the period of exposure. It is not ordinarily necessary to calculate the effect of direct exposure, as this is significant only near the plant itself. Equation (11.92) then includes all relevant exposures. Population doses, especially at long distances, are best computed using the wedge model described in the preceding section. Then, from Fig. 11.14, if P (r) is the population density at r, the number of people living between rand r + dr is P (r )r8dr. If these people receive the dose H (r), then the population dose between RI and R2 is J.R2 Hpop = H(r)P(r)r8dr Rj J.R2 = C XT(r)P(r)r8dr. Rj (11.93) With a total release of Q units of radioactivity and with deposition and inftight decay, both of which are very important in this type of calculation, XT (r) is given by XT(r) = � ar8u Introducing this expression into Eq. (11.93) gives CQ J.R2 Hpop = -_-P(r)e-(A+A/v)r dr. au Rj In the special case where P is approximately constant, Hpop = _ (CQ 1) [e-(AH/u)R, -e-(AH/u)R,]. au A + -=-u (11.94) (11.95) (11.96) It is of interest to observe that the angle of the wedge, 8, does not appear in Eqs.

Thus, an accident in a reactor located in a heavily popUlated area could involve more of the public than the same accident in a remote location. Also, a nuclear power plant, like any other industrial installation, cannot help having some affect on the local environment. For these reasons, reactor siting is a major consideration in the design and licensing of a nuclear plant. In an application for a construction pennit, an applicant must show to the satisfaction of the NRC that the plant can be built and operated at a proposed site without undue risk to the health and safety of the public and with minimal effect on the environment. Furthennore, one must show that the proposed site is the most acceptable among a number of alternate sites. The present section is related to the safety aspects of reactor siting. Some of the environmental questions involved in siting are discussed in Section 11.9. The NRC considers four factors in evaluating the suitability of a proposed reactor site.12 First, it considers the reactor itself, its design characteri stics, and its proposed mode of operation. Special attention is paid to the expected inventory of radioactivity and to the extent to which the reactor is designed to prevent and mit­ igate the consequences of a release of radioactivity. Needless to say, if the reactor involves a substantial departure from earlier technology or is a design where that experience is lacking, special siting requirements may be considered to ensure an ample margin of safety. Second, the NRC evaluation considers the population density in and use char­ acteristics of the environs of the site. This is an involved question and is discussed later. Third, the NRC considers the physical characteri stics of the site. These in­ clude the seismology, meteorology, geology, and hydrology of the area. Each of these topics is also discussed later in this section. Finally, in the event that the population density or the physical characteri stics of the site are unfavorab le for the location of the reactor and the applicant proposes 12NRC regulations regarding reactor site criteria are contained in 10 CFR 100; the regulations in this part apply to power reactors and testing reactors (generally speaking, research reactors oper­ ating at a power in excess of 10MW). For the siting of research reactors, the NRC uses as criteria the general regulations of Title 10, pertinent sections of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and accumulated court decisions. See also Regulatory Guide 4.7, "General Site Suitability Criteria for Nuclear Power Stations."

page number: 688
 text: 670 Reactor Licensing Chap. 11 to circumvent this problem by the use of appropriate engineering safeguard s, the NRC will evaluate the adquacy of these safeguard s. For example, suppose that a utility wishes to place a nuclear power plant near the end of an active airport run­ way. Such a site would be unacceptable if the probability of an airplane crash were above some minimum value. However, if the utility indicates that it will harden the plant against such crashes by reinforcing the structure in some way, the site might well be approved. The Three Mile Island Reactor is such a plant, located near an active airport. The reactor's design and construction incorporate unique safety features to reinforce the plant's structure and control systems. Population Considerations For the purpose of evaluating a proposed reactor site and for making comparisons with possible alternate sites, the NRC has defined two areas in the vicinity of the reactor as follows (10 CFR 100.3): 1. An exclusion area, or exclusion zone, is "that area surrounding the reactor in which the reactor licensee has the authority to determine all activities includ­ ing exclusion or removal of personnel and property from the area Res­ idents within the exclusion area shall normally be prohibited. In any event, residents shall be subject to ready removal in case of necessity 2. A low-population zone (LPZ) is "the area immediately surrounding the ex­ clusion area which contains residents, the total number and density of which are such that there is a reasonable probability that appropriate protective mea­ sures could be taken in their behalf in the event of a serious accident In short, the exclusion area is a piece of property usually belonging to the re­ actor licensee, which he can surround with a fence and from which he can exclude everyone not connected with the operation of the facility. The LPZ is the surround­ ing area that contains so few people that it can be easily evacuated should the need arise. The boundaries of these two areas are defined in terms of the consequences of a serious, postulated reactor accident involving a major release of fission products . Again, quoting from 10 CFR 100, "an exclusion area [is] of such a size that an individual located at any point on its boundary for two hours immediately following onset of the postulated fission product release would not receive a total radiation dose to the whole body in excess of 25 rem or a total radiation dose in excess of 300 rem to the thyroid from iodine exposure." On the other hand, the "low population zone [is] of such size that an individ­ ual located at any point on its outer boundary who is exposed to the radioactive

page number: 689
 text: Sec. 11.6 Reactor Siting 671 cloud resulting from the postulated fission product release (during the entire period of its passage) would not receive a total radiation dose to the whole body in excess of 25 rem or a total radiation dose in excess of 300 rem to the thyroid from iodine exposure." It should be noted that while the 25-rem and 300-rem doses generally fall within the guidelines of the NCRP for emergency exposure, the NRC does not imply that these are in any way acceptable doses to the public under accident con­ ditions. They are used merely as guides for the evaluation of reactor sites. As will be shown in the next section, considerably smaller doses can actually be expected from realistic appraisals of reactor accidents. As another aid in site evaluation, the NRC also defines the population center distance. This is defined as "the distance from the reactor to the nearest boundary of a densely populated center containing more than 25,000 residents." It is impossible, of course, to predict precisely what the decision of the NRC will be with regard to the acceptability of any particular site. Such decisions nat­ urally involve a certain amount of judgment on the part of the persons involved. Generally speaking, however, the NRC will not accept a site for which an applicant cannot provide an exclusion area of the necessary size. Ordinarily, the NRC also requires that the population center distance be no less than 1.33 times the radius of the LPZ. Furthermore, in evaluating two otherwise comparable sites, the NRC normally will accept the site having the smaller number of residents in the LPZ. Thus, the NRC has acted emphatically to encourage the siting of nuclear reactors where the fewest individuals could become involved. 13 This is also in accord with the policy of keeping the total man-rems received by the public as low as possible. However, the nature of the population in the LPZ must also be taken into account, as it relates to the ease with which the zone can be evacuated. The size of the exclusion area and LPZ are determined by a postulated seri­ ous accident in the plant. This accident assumes that a significant fraction of the gaseous and volatile fission products are released into the containment and that they then leak to the environment at a specified rate determined by the characteri stics of the containment structure. Until now, the fraction of radioactivity assumed to be released to the containment has been defined arbitrarily, rather than being based on analysis of a specific accident scenario. However, the technique for calculating the actual release for various accident scenarios has improved greatly in recent years, so the NRC has recently released Regulatory Guide 1.183 that allows the use of alternative source terms based on more realistic criteria. The assumptions that the NRC makes in calculating the radii of the exclusion area and the LPZ are contained in Regulatory Guide 1.3 (for BWRs) and 1.4 (for 13The history of power reactor siting shows some cases where applicants ultimately abandoned or moved site locations because of population density considerations.

 text: 672 Reactor Licensing Chap. 11 PWRS).14 In simplified form, these are as follows: 1. Prior to the accident, the reactor has been operating at full power long enough for the fission product activity to come to equilibrium, except for the longest­ lived nuclides. 2. The accident immediately releases into the reactor building (containment) 25% of the iodine inventory (91 % are in elemental form, 5% are particulates, and 4% are organic iodides15) and 100% of the noble gas inventory. 3. The effect of containment sprays and recirculation filter systems in reducing the airborne activity in containment are taken into account if they are present in the plant. (These are discussed further in Section 11.7.) 4. The gas within the containment leaks at a rate characteri stic of the structure. 5. The gas is released from containment at ground level and is dispersed under Pasquill F conditions for the first 8 hrs with a wind speed of 1 mlsec; after 8 hrs, the gas disperses under a specified mixture of conditions and wind speeds. 6. There is no depletion of the cloud as the result of deposition on the ground. 7. The fission products do not decay en route in the atmosphere. These assumptions are used to compute the external and internal dose from the effluent cloud and the direct dose from nuclides within the building in the man­ ner discussed in the preceding section. Ordinarily, the internal thyroid dose from iodine is the dominant mode of exposure. To begin the computation, it is first necessa ry to determine the inventories of the various fission products. Suppose that the reactor has been operating at a power of P MW. If the recoverable energy per fission is taken to be 200 Me V, the total number of fissions occurring per second in the reactor is 106 joule fissions MeV Fission rate = PMW x x x ------- MW-sec 200 MeV 1.60 x 10-13joule = 3.13 x 1016 P fissions/sec. 14 As of this writing, 10 CFR 100 still refers to the 1962 report TID- 14844 (see the references at the end of this chaper) for guidance in calculating exclusion areas and LPZs. However, this report has been largely superceded by the Regulatory Guides, which contain more detailed assumptions regarding a LOCA and a new section for reactors built after 1997. 150rganic iodides, mostly methyl iodide, are formed by the reaction of iodine with oils, greases, and other organic materials located in the containment building. They are not subject to washout or plate-out within the building.

(1l.97) reduces to (1l.98) Table 11.4 gives the inventories of the most important noble gases and iodine fission products computed for a typical 1,000 MWe plant at the end of a fuel cycle. The amount of a fission product available for release to the atmosphere can be estimated by (1l.99) where Fp is the fraction of the radionuclide released from the fuel into the reactor containment and Fb is the fraction of this that remains airborne and capable of escaping from the building. Example 11.9 The fission yield of 131 I is 2.77%. Calculate the saturation activity of this nuclide in a reactor operating 1,000 MWe (3,200 MW) and the activity released in elemental form into the reactor containment in a meltdown under the assumptions given, ignoring assumption 3. Solution. The value of y is 0.0277. From Eq. (11.98), (Xi = 8.46 X 105 x 3.2 X 103 x 0.0277 = 7.50 x 107 Ci. [Ans.] [Note: This differs slightly from the value calculated in Table 11.4 by a more accurate method.] 16The cumulative yield of a fission product is the yield of the product itself plus the yields of all its short-lived precursors. 17This equation is only approximate, as it does not account for removal by neutron absorption or for changes in yield as the neutron energy spectrum changes. In most cases, such corrections are small.

Then, taking Fb = 1 gives Co = 7.50 X 107 x 0.2275 = 1.71 x 107 Ci. [Ans.] With the source of radiation known, the doses to the public can be calculated and the prospective exclusion and low-population radii evaluated in the following way: first, the 2-hr dose to the thyroid is computed as a function of distance from a reactor operating at 1 MW for all of the iodines, 1311 through 1351, taken together, exactly as was done in Example 11.7 for 131 I. The defining dose, namely, 300 rems, is next divided by the computed dose. This quotient gives the reactor power at which the 300-rem dose is received in 2 hrs. For example, if 1 MW gives a dose of 0.5 rem at 1,000 m, then 300 rems would be received at the same point if the reactor operated at 300/0.5 = 600 MW. When this procedure is carried out for a number of points, the result is a curve similar to that shown in Fig. 11.17, of the reactor power that gives 300 rems to the thyroid in 2 hrs as a function of distance. It should be mentioned that in siting considerations at the CP licensing stage, the thyroid dose for defining the exclusion area and LPZ is taken to be 150 rems, rather than 300 rems, to allow for uncertainties in the plant design and in the local meteorology. Thus, the thyroid curve in the figure is also computed for 150 rems-

(From J. J. DiNunno, et al., USAEC Report TID-14844, 1962.) and, indeed, it is common practice to compute a family of such curves for different defining doses as an aid in comparing alternate sites. The 2-hr external and direct dose versus distance is also computed for 1 MW and then divided into 25 rems. This computation is somewhat more lengthy, as it must be made for all of the dozen or so important y -emitting fission products released into and from the reactor building. The results of these computations are also shown in Fig. 11.17.18 For a given reactor power, both the internal and direct doses decrease with distance from the reactor. Therefore, the exclusion distance is determined by the defining dose, 300 rems internal or 25 rems direct, that is received farthest from the plant. As shown in the figure, the direct dose is controlling up to a power of about 300 MW, the thyroid dose controls beyond that point. 181n the calculations on which Fig. 11.17 is based, the external dose from the noble gases is ignored. On the other hand, the calculation does not include the effects of containment shielding, filters, or sprays that would further reduce the exclusion area.

The direct dose is negligible at the distances involved and is not included in the figure. Physical Characteristics of Site Nuclear power plants must be designed and constructed in such a manner that all structures and systems important to safety can withstand the effects of earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, and other natural phenomena, without a loss of safety function. The physical characteri stics of a proposed site must therefore be consid­ ered with some care in evaluating its acceptability. Seismology Geologists now believe that the surface of the earth is com­ posed of large structures called tectonic plates. Figure 11.19 shows the major tectonic plates that have been identified. These plates are under pressure to move relative to one another as the result of the heat stored within the earth. They do not move smoothly, however, because the edges of the plates, also called faults,

 text: 678 Reactor Licensing Chap. 11 are rough and jagged. In time, when the stress energy along a fault becomes large enough, the plates undergo relatively sudden movement, and an earthquake is the result. The white dots in Fig. 11.19 show the centers of 42,000 earthquakes recorded between 1961 and 1969. It will be observed that the vast bulk of these occurred along the boundaries of the tectonic plates. The magnitude of an earthquake (i.e., the total amount of energy released) is measured in terms of the Richter scale. The energy E in ergs is related to the magnitude M on this scale by the following empirical fonnula: loglO E = 11.4 + 1.5M. (11.100) It should be noted that this is a logarithmic scale, and the energy increases rapidly with M. For instance, if EM and EM+1 are energies associated with earthquakes of magnitude M and M + 1, respectively, then from Eq. (11.100), EM+1 = 101.5 = 31.6. EM Thus, an increase of 1 on the Richter scale corresponds to an increase in energy by a factor of almost 32. Comparing earthquakes of magnitudes 4 and 8, we find that the latter releases nearly one million (31.64) times more energy. For purposes of structural design, it is necessary to know the maximum ac­ celeration of the ground in an earthquake. This is called the intensity of the quake, and is measured by the modified Mercalli scale. This scale is divided into 12 cate­ gories, each category giving a somewhat subjective evaluation of the consequences of an earthquake. Table 11.5 shows these categories, together with the approxima te associated accelerati on. As indicated in the table, the Mercalli scale varies roughly logarithmically with acceleration. Thus, I on this scale, is given approximately by I = 1 + 3loglOa, (11.101) where a is the acceleration in cm/sec2• The technology of predicting the occurrence of earthquakes has not pro­ gressed to the point where it is possible to say precisely when or where an earth­ quake will occur. However, based on an analysis of the seismological history of the area in the vicinity of a site, its geological fonnation, and, in particular, the distance from the site to known faults, the likelihood and magnitude of an earthquake at the site can be reasonably assessed. In terms of the Mercalli scale, the maximum earth­ quake deduced from this analysis is called the safe shutdown earthquake. Safety­ related portions of the plant must be functional following such an earthquake. In this regard, nuclear plants are usually designed conservatively. For example, if the largest earthquake ever recorded in a particular region is a Mercalli VII, and there are no known faults in the area, it is likely that a 0.2-g accelerati on, which is well into the Mervalli VIII category, would be required.

 text: 680 Reactor Licensing Chap. 11 Meteoro logy The importance of meteorological conditions on the disper­ sion of effluents from a nuclear plant was discussed in Section 11.4. Unfavorab le condition s-for instance, the presence of frequent inversions -can militate against the location of a plant at a particular site. Meteoro logical factors must also be considered to guarantee the integrity of safety-related structures in hurricanes and tornadoes. Hurricanes are defined as large stonns, up to 600 miles in diameter, with winds from 75 to 200 milhr. They occur most frequently in the late summer and early autumn in the Caribbean and along the Gulf of Mexico and the eastern coast of the United States and in the late spring and early summer in the southern hemisphere. (They are called typhoons in the Near and Far East.) Tornadoes, by contrast, are defined as smaller and more intense stonns than hurricanes. Their diameters range from several feet to a mile. Horizont al winds rotate about the axis of a tornado with speeds of 100 to 300 milhr. There is also an updraft at the center with vertical winds as high as 200 milhr. Tornadoes most frequently occur in the central and eastern United States. They travel generally in a north-easterly direction at speeds of from 10 to 70 milhr and where they touch the ground they cause considerable destruction. Reactor structures must be designed not only to withstand the direct force of tornado winds and the associated drop in pressure, but also to withstand the impact of objects that have been picked up by the winds and hurled against the structure. Typical tornado missiles used in safety studies are 1,500-lb utility poles moving at 180 ftlsec and 4,000-lb automob iles at 75 ftlsec. Geology Studies must be made of the geological structure of a proposed site in order to detennine whether the area can finnly support the reactor building with all its internal components. The details of these studies are beyond the scope of this text, however, and will not be discussed further. Hydrology It is necessary to prevent large quantities of water from en­ tering the site of a nuclear power plant, since water could compromise some of the safety-related systems of the plant. For example, offsite power could be jeop­ ardized, especially if the water enters the plant from underground; the emergency diesel generators could be rendered inoperative; and so on. Rushing water conceiv­ ably could crush building walls, burst steam pipes, etc. The particular types of hydrological phenomena that must be considered ob­ viously depend upon the nature and location of the site. If, for instance, the site is on the seashore, it is necessary to estimate the largest tidal wave or tsunami or hurricane-driven wave that may be incident on the site. The maximum flood level must be ascertained for a plant sited along a lake, river, or estuary. The possibility that the bursting of a dam may lead to the sudden inundation of the plant must

page number: 699
 text: Sec. 11.7 Reactor Accidents 681 also be examined. Dikes of appropriate size or watertight structures must then be designed to withstand the maximum expected water invasion. 11.7 REACTOR ACCIDENTS In the prelimina ry and final safety analysis reports (PSAR and FSAR), an appli­ cant for a reactor license must analyze a set of postulated, severe accidents to show that the facility can be operated without undue risk to the health and safety of the public. These are called design basis accidents (DBA). For the purpose of evalu­ ating the safety of the plant, these accidents are analyzed within the framework of highly conservative assumptions that tend to exaggerate the consequences of each accident. They are used as a basis for the design of plant safety features. In the Environmental Report, the applicant must discuss the environmental ef­ fects of a broader range of possible accidents. Because the objective of this analysis is an accurate assessment of the environmental impact of the plant, these accidents may be considered in the light of more realistic and less conservative assumptions than those utilized in the safety analysis of the facility. For the purpose of standard­ ization, the NRC has divided the spectrum of possible accidents into nine classes, in increasing order of severity. These are listed in an annex to Appendix D of 10 CFR 50; an outline of the classes is given in Table 11.6. Class 1 accidents are trivial and involve releases of radioactivity that are not substantially different from those accompanying normal operation of the plant. Ac­ cidents of Class 2 through 8 entail the release of increasingly significant amounts of activity. Class 8 accidents include the DBAs analyzed in the PSAR and FSAR. Class 9 accidents involve a broad range of events that, while more serious than those of Class 8, are so improbable that they can be ignored in analyzing both the safety and environmental aspects of the plant. Such accidents are not specifically defined and therefore do not appear in the table. They involve either an incredible sequence of unlikely events or a single improbable event of major proportions. An example of a Class 9 accident of the first type is the simultaneous failure of all off­ site and on-site power at the moment of a LOCA. An accident of the second type could result from the sudden rupture of the pressure vessel. Another accident of this kind might occur if the containment building were struck by a heavily loaded civilian aircraft or by a military aircraft carrying bombs. The likelihood of these accidents is extraordinarily remote, and accordingly they are categorized as Class 9 events. Loss-of-Co olant Accident Any unexpected decrease in coolant flow through a reactor core can lead to seri­ ous consequences for the plant as a whole. Such a drop in flow can be caused by

See text. anything from a leak in a small coolant pipe to the complete severance (sometimes called a "guillotine" break) of a major coolant pipe. It is the latter that is the start­ ing point of a design basis LOCA. In a PWR plant, the break in question occurs in one of the primary coolant loops, while in a BWR, the break is in a recircu­ lation loop. With the HTGR, all of the primary loops (there are four or six loops in currently designed plants, depending on the reactor power) are located within the prestressed concrete reactor vessel (PCRV) as indicated in Fig. 4.25. The event corresponding to a pipe break in a PWR or BWR is the gross failure of one of the PCRV penetration closures. Although this would lead to the rapid escape of the he­ lium coolant, such a LOCA for the HTGR is called a design basis depressurization accident (DBDA) .

 text: Sec. 11.7 Reactor Accidents 683 If the containment structure is not present or is improperly designed or if the emergency core cooling system (ECCS) is not present or is inoperable, the conse­ quences of a LOCA is very serious, especially for a PWR or BWR plant. To begin with, the water is under great pressure, and on the breaking of the pipe, the water flows out and flashes to steam. More important, in the absence of an ECCS the uncovered fuel rods melt because of fission product heating. This, in tum, leads to the initiation of various exothermic chemical reactions between the molten mate­ rial and the water-steam mixture, some of which produce hydrogen. Furthermore, the pool of molten fuel and structural material at the bottom of the reactor vessel might, in time, melt its way through the vessel, then through the concrete under­ lying the reactor building, and then sink into the ground. In the United States this phenomenon is often referred to as the China syndrome (and presumably in China as the US syndrome), because of the ancient myth that if one digs directly down­ ward from a point in the United States one eventually reaches China.19 Extensive measures are taken to prevent a core meltdown, because of the potential for releas­ ing large amounts of fission products. To avoid core meltdown and to lessen the consequences of a LOCA, as well as the assumptions underlying the analysis of a LOCA, the ECCS and associated systems are somewhat different for the PWR, BWR, and HTGR. Each will now be considered, in turn. The PWR LOCA Safety Systems The ECCS is divided into an active and a passive system. The passive system consists of large accumula tor tanks (one per primary loop) containing borated water under a blanket of nitrogen at a pressure of about 650 psi. When the pressure in the reactor vessel falls below this value, the reversal of pressure across a check valve causes the tanks to discharge into the cold legs of the primary coolant loops and then through the core. This passive system provides automatic rapid cooling of the core in the case of large breaks that might result in the uncovering and overheating of the core, before the electrically driven, active part of the ECCS can be put into operation. The active system, in tum, is divided into high-pressure and low-pressu re coolant injection systems. In the low-pressure system, pumps take water either from a large water storage tank20 or from the containment sump and pass it through heat exchangers and into the hot legs of the primary coolant loops. Following a nor­ mal shutdown of the reactor, the low-pressure system is also used for the removal 19In fact, however, the molten material could only melt a rather short distance before solidifying. 20The water in these tanks is normally used for refueling the reactor, a procedure that must be done under water.

page number: 702
 text: 684 Reactor Licensing Chap. 11 of residual fission product decay heat. The high-pressure system often utilizes the charging pumps which are in continuous operation for the chemical shim system when the reactor is critical. Upon an actuation signal, the suction from these pumps is quickly diverted to pumping water from the storage tank through the boron shim tank and into the cold legs of the primary coolant system. Consider now the sequence of events following a postulated guillotine break of a PWR primary coolant pipe. Immediately, high-pressure, subcooled water rushes out of the break and flashes to steam in the containment structure. As a result, the pressure in the reactor vessel quickly drops to the saturation pressure, in the neighborhood of 1,500 psi, corresponding to an average water temperature of about 600°F. Thereafter, a mixture of steam and water flows out the break until the pressure in the reactor and in the containment building become equal (at a pressure somewhat under 45 psi, a typical design pressure for PWR containment) . This is known as the blowdown phase of a LOCA. For the first few seconds following the break, the fuel and cladding temper­ atures remain roughly constant, as indicated in Fig. 11.20, but with the onset of boiling, about 5 secs after the break, the temperature rises rapidly. For complex reasons, having to do with the flow of the water-steam mixture out of the vessel, the cladding temperature, after reaching a peak value of nearly 1 ,400°F, drops again as shown in the figure, because of the action of the ECCS. Incidentally, as soon as boiling occurs in the core, the reactor falls subcritical, because of the negative void coefficient. The first action of the ECCS is the flow of water from the accumula tor tanks, which commences when the pressure has dropped below about 650 psi. The cladding temperature soon levels off. However, the capacity of the accumula tor tanks is limited, so to provide continued core cooling, the low-pressu re pumps come into action, first carrying additional water from the refueling tank to the reactor vessel. Because of the break in the primary coolant pipe, most of the pri­ mary coolant water, the borated water from the accumulators, and the low-pressu re water from the refueling tank ultimately passes out through the break. All of this water is collected in a large sump at the bottom of the containment building and is pumped through the low-pressure heat removal system after the level in the refueling tank falls to a predetermined level. In this way, the reactor is guaran­ teed an endless supply of recycled core cooling water. The heat absorbed from the core is carried outside the plant via the heat exchangers which have cooling water from an external source on their cold side in the low-pressure heat removal system. In the case of a small break or a crack in the primary coolant loop, the blow­ down and depressurization occur much more slowly, and the outflowing of primary coolant could lead to the uncovering of a portion of the core before the flow of water from accumula tors and the low-pressure coolant system is initiated. This situation

With the onset of a LOCA, several other components of a PWR plant in ad­ dition to the ECCS operate to lessen the effect of the incident. The containment structure is particularly important in this regard. This must be strong enough to hold the coolant that has flashed to steam and tight enough to contain whatever radioactivity is released in the accident. Several spray nozzles are located in the upper part of the building and are connected, with appropriate redundancy, to the refueling water storage tank and the containment sump. When these sprays are actuated, they perform two functions. First, they condense the steam and thereby limit the pressure in the containment atmosphere to below the design pressure for the building. Second, they remove (i.e., wash out) enough of the iodine and other nongaseous fusion products released from the fuel (see later) to the containment

To further reduce the amount of radioactive material available for leakage from the building, in some reactor designs the containment atmosphere is continuously recircula ted through various types of filters. PWR LOCA Doses The dose received off-site from a LOCA is usually analyzed on the basis of two sets of assumpti ons. The first is contained in NRC Regulatory Guide 1.4, which is discussed in Section 11.6 in connection with reactor siting. These assumptions are highly conservative. It will be recalled, in particular, that 25% of the iodine inventory and 100% of the noble gas inventory are assumed to be immediately released into containment. Such a fission product release could occur only if a substantial fraction of the fuel melts. In fact, however, if the ECCS is functioning properly, little if any of the fuel melts, although some of the fuel cladding is probably damaged. Thus, a far more realistic, but still conservative, assumption is that all the noble gases and a fraction of the iodine contained in the pellet-cladding gap and are in the plenum of the fuel rods is released to the containment. The amount of fission product gas in the gap and plenum can be estimated from a diffusion calculation of the flow of gas out of the surface of the U02, using an empirical formula for the diffusion coefficient. Table 11.7 gives the results of these calculations for a PWR operating at a nominal power of 1,000 MWe. For PWR LOCA dose calculations, the atmospheric dispersion conditions are given in Regulatory Guide 1.4. Table 11.8 shows the computed thyroid and whole-body doses at the exclusion and low-population boundaries (indicated as EZB and LPZ, respectively) for a PWR operating at 3,216 MW. In the calculations, leakage from the building is 0.1 % per day, and the spray system provides an iodine concentration decay constant of 32 hr-1 , to be added to the radioactive and leakage decay constants. As seen in the table, the conservative assumption of total gap­ plenum release gives small doses for this event. 21 Three Mile Island Accident. The accident at the Three Mile Island nu­ clear power station (TMI) near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in March 1979 is one of the worst that has occurred in a commercial nuclear power plant. The plant in­ volved, TMI Unit 2, a 900 MWe PWR, was operating at nearly full power when the accident happened. During maintenance operations, the feedwater flow to the steam generator was lost, an event that can be expected to happen two or three 21 It should be mentioned that the PWR installation in question has valves that effectively iso­ late the containment building from the rest of the plant. These valves are closed within approximately one minute after the onset of a LOCA. Beyond that time, there conceivably could be no leakage what­ soever from the building. With a building release lasting only one minute, the overall dose at the EZB is less than one-third of a rem and at the LPZ about 0.1 rem, both for the gap release.

Because of the sudden loss of heat removal, pressure began to increase in the primary system. The pressure rise was terminated by inserting the control rods, but before this could take full effect, the pressure ex­ cursion caused the relief valve on the pressurizer (which acts as an expansion tank for the reactor coolant) to open. This was the expected sequence of events follow- TABLE 11.8 DOSES FROM A LOCA IN A 3,216-MW PWR* LPZ (0.7 mi) EZB (350 m)t 30 days, Assumed release 2 hr, rem rem Regulatory Guide 1.4 Thyroid 189 130 Whole body 9.74 8.54 Gap-plenum Thyroid 3.5 2.9 Whole body 0.04 0.07 *From the PSAR for Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit No.3, Consolidated Edison Company of New York. t Actually, the site boundary, which lies somewhat within the EZB.

It failed to do so and thus created a small break LOCA in the primary system. At this point, the system pressure began to drop, and this automatically turned on the high-pressure ECCS, which worked properly. After a short time, the operator thought that the primary system was once again full of water; to prevent over filling the system, he turned off the ECCS. Unfortunately, the reading on the water level indicator was not indicative of the water level in the reactor itself, and, therefore , the ECCS water should not have been turned off. In a short time, the water level in the reactor dropped below the top of the fuel, which became severely overheated. As a result, a significant fraction of the gaseous and volatile fission products were released from the fuel. In addition, the Zircaloy cladding began to react with the water to produce hydrogen. Subsequent analysis has shown that about 50% of the noble gases, iodine, and cesium were released from the fuel. Almost all the cesium and iodine were trapped in the water that was present, but most of the noble gases were released to the containment air. The fraction of the iodine released to the atmosphere was about 2 x 10-7, while that of the noble gases krypton and xenon was about 0.1 (10%). No cesium was measured outside of the plant. The maximum off -site radiation dose was less than 0.1 rad, and the total population dose was about 10 person-rem s. This is below the level that would be expected to produce any health effects. Despite the very serious nature of the accident, the safety systems worked very well to protect the pUblic. There are, however, many important lessons to be learned from this event. (See Pigford article cited in the references at the end of this chapter.) Industry and the regulators have carefully reviewed the accident and have put into practice a number of changes that should reduce the likelihood of such events in the future. The Chernobyl Accident. The Chernobyl reactor was a graphite­ moderated boiling water pressure tube reactor of the RBMK -1,000 type discussed in Chapter 4. In this type reactor, the pressure vessel is replaced by a large number of pressure tubes. The fuel is located in these tubes. The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, which consists of four RBMK 1,000 reactors, is situated near the Ukranian City of Kiev in a forest area (Polesje) directly on the banks of the river Pripjat. At the time of the accident, four reactor units were operating at the site. The accident took place in Unit number four on April 26, 1986, when the plant was being shut down as planned. During the shutdown process, a test to demon­ strate certain safety features of the plant was planned. Deficiencies in the test pro­ gram, unexpected conditions during the perfonnance of the test, as well as several unforeseeable events and unplanned actions by the operating staff, led to an ex­ tremely unstable operating condition. This eventually caused the reactor to undergo

page number: 707
 text: Sec. 11.7 Reactor Accidents 689 a prompt, supercritical power excursion that led to the disastrous failure of the reactor. Several features of the RBMK-type reactor and several unique conditions at Chemobyl contributed to the accident. These features included a high positive void reactivity during operational conditions with high fuel bumups; a positive shut­ down effect of fully withdrawn control rods; insufficient effectiveness of shutdown facilities; and a lower than expected shutdown reactivity margin. The RBMK has a different reactivity behavior because of the utilization of graphite as a moderator and water as a coolant. The coolant water works as neutron moderator and neutron absorber at the same time. While the moderator effect of water is of minor importance compared with the one of graphite, the reactivity behavior of the reactor is considerably influenced by the neutron absorption of the water. A reduction of the coolant density (e.g., by voiding) or a loss of coolant leads to a significant reduction of neutron absorption in the reactor core. An increase of the steam content in the pressure tubes results in an increase in reactivity. The RBMK thus has a positive steam void reactivity effect or positive void coefficient. Furthennore, the void effect grows strongly positive in the course of operation as higher fuel burnups are achieved. One special feature of RBMK reactors prior to the accident was a positive reactivity effect of the control rod motion. Of the control rods, 163 are inserted from the top of the reactor and consist of an absorber part of approximately 6 m in length and a displacement part made of graphite 4.5 m in length. When the control rod is completely withdrawn, the center graphite containing part of the control rod is approximately in the center of the reactor core. Above and below this part, the control rod channel is filled by columns of water. If a control rod is inserted into the core from this position, the neutron moderating part of the control rod that contains the graphite replaces the lower, more neutron absorbing, water column. Thus, the opposite of the intended effect is attained at first: The reactor power is not reduced by the control rod insertion; instead, it initially increases, due to decreased absorption and increased moderati on. As mentioned before, on the day of the accident a series of tests was planned. The accident occurred when the plant was being shut down as planned in prepa­ ration for these tests. During the shutdown process, a test to demonst rate certain safety properties of the plant had been intended. Immediately prior to the initia­ tion of the test, the plant was in an extremely unstable condition, as there was an unfavorable loading condition, a low power level with an unfavora ble power dis­ tribution, a high coolant flow rate in the core, a reduced feedwater flow rate to the reactor with increasing coolant temperature at the core inlet, and an unstable xenon spatial distribution. At 1 :23 am, the test was initiated. As planned, four main coolant pumps were slowed down, reducing coolant flow. The reduction of the coolant flow rate in the

page number: 708
 text: 690 Reactor Licensing Chap. 11 reactor core connected with the test, and the shutdown of the reactor actuated a short time later, coupled with the unstable state of the plant at first led to a power increase of more than 15% and then, within a few seconds, to an uncontrolled reactor power excursion. The reactor excursion led to a rapid increase of the en­ ergy release in the fuel elements and to the destruction of the reactor core. The heat stored in the fuel was very quickly transferred to the surrounding coolant, the coolant practically evaporated, which further increased power, due to the positive void reactivity effect. The resulting large pressure increase led to the explosion of the reactor. The explosion destroyed large parts of the reactor building of Unit 4, the tur­ bine building, and the connecting building. The walls of the reactor building were partially destroyed, and the roof was destroyed completely. Figure 11.21 shows the reactor building shortly after the accident. The energy release was sufficient to ignite the graphite blocks, resulting in a fire. The fire spread fuel and fission prod­ ucts throughout the reactor building and into the surrounding countryside. People residing in the nearby town were exposed to large doses of radiation and inhaled significant amounts of radioactive iodine and other radioisotopes. Because of the extent of the damage and the extreme radiation levels that exist even today at the damaged reactor, a Sarcophagu s, Fig. 11.22, was built around the destroyed reac­ tor unit. The Sarcophagus was built to limit the release of radioactive material into the environment and to safely enclose the radioactivity in the destroyed unit for 30 years. It is estimated that about 3.5% of the fuel was ejected from the reactor, all of the radioactive noble gases, and approximately 33% of the core inventory of cesium, and about 50% of the iodine 131 inventory was released as well. Table 11.9 gives an estimate of the released fraction of many of the isotopes in the core. Prevailing winds carried the radioactive releases to northern Europe and to Scandinavia. The operating staff of the reactor, firemen, and members of the army (e.g., helicopter pilots) were employed to immediately fight the fire and to cover the exposed reactor core. About 300 persons were taken to the hospital. Part of this group, 134 people, received very high dose rates and showed signs of acute ra­ diation sickness with weakness, vomiting, and dizziness, as well as skin bums. Despite intensive medical efforts, including, with the help of American surgeons, bone-ma rrow transplants in specialized hospitals in Moscow and Kiev, 28 persons died of radiation sickness and fire injuries. The total-body doses were up to 13 Gy. At a body dose of 4 Gy, the chance of survival is about 50%. The radiation exposure of the population caused by the reactor accident can essentially be attributed to the short-lived Iodine 131 and the long-lived Cesium 137 released in the explosion and subsequent fire. Immediately after the accident, Soviet authorities ordered emergency protective measures. The most severely af-

Further evacuations followed when additional exposed areas were found by monitoring program s. The areas in the Ukraine, Belorussia, and Russia affected by the reactor acci­ dent, report a general increase of diseases among the population, especially stress­ related illnesses such as depressions, anxieties, and other psychological problems. Also, chronic bronchitis, high blood pressure, coronary diseases and diabetes are being diagnosed more and more. According to present findings, these diseases

page number: 711
 text: Sec. 11.7 Reactor Accidents 693 cannot be directly attributed to the radiation exposure. But they are, nevertheless, considered as indirect consequences of the accident and the expulsion of many thousands of people from their familiar circumsta nces. One reason for a part of these diseases may also be the general impairment of the social and economic situ­ ation after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the uncertainties connected there­ with. The increase of contagious diseases (e.g., diptheria and tuberculosis) might also be connected with this impairment of the general living conditions and the insufficient medical treatment. Nontheless, there are clear indications that the radiological consequences of the accident had a negative impact on the general health of the exposed population. Most evident is the increase in thyroid cancer among children in Belorussia and in the areas affected in the Ukraine and the Russian Federation. Epidemiologists have seen a highly statistically significant increase among this cohort during the period between 1986 and 1994. From 1981 to 1985, a total of 39 cases of thyroid cancer occurred in this region. Between 1986 and 1995, 565 children in these areas contracted thyroid cancer, an increase of 1,000%. Thyroid cancer of children can generally be treated by surgical removal with good success, but it does require long-term therapy. Despite the operation, some children have died in Belorussia. TheBWR LOCA Safety Systems BWRs, like PWRs, have multiple provisions for reducing the consequences of a LOCA. These provisions also vary somewhat from plant to plant. A typical BWR ECCS consists of a low-pressure coolant injection system and independent high-and low-pressure core spray systems. These systems, together with the containment and suppression pool, are designed to function in the following way in the event of a LOCA. Suppose first that there is a small break in the reactor coolant system that does not result in a rapid depressurization of the reactor vessel above some pre­ selected height and that additional water is provided by a high-pressure, turbine­ driven pump, operated by steam diverted from the main steam line. Water is first supplied from a condensa te water storage tank and later from the suppression pool. The water enters the reactor either by way of a special ring of nozzles located over the core or via the normal feedwater nozzles, depending on the model of BWR. Should the high-pressure coolant injection system fail to maintain the water level, the reactor vessel is depressurized. This depressurization is accomplished by the automatic opening of pressure relief valves located on the main steam line piping. Steam from the vessel then enters the primary containment dry well, from which it is conducted to the suppression pool as explained in Section 11.3. If the original pipe break is large, the depressurization occurs without relief valve assis­ tance by the rapid coolant blowdown through the break.

page number: 712
 text: 694 Reactor Licensing Chap. 11 With the depressurization of the vessel, the low-pressure core spray system and the low-pressure coolant injection system are actuated. In the former, electric pumps carry water from the suppression pool to a ring of nozzles above the core similar to those in the high-pressure system. The low-pressure coolant injection system pumps water from the suppression pool directly into the reactor recircula­ tion loops. In normal operation, this system is also used for the removal of fission product heat after shutdown of the reactor. As in the PWR plant described earlier, all of the water flowing out of the break in the pipe is collected-in the BWR case in the suppression pool-thus assuring a continuing source of cooling water. Recent versions of BWR plants are also equipped with a filtration, recircula­ tion, and ventilation system (FRVS) for reducing the release of airborne radioac­ tivity to the environment. In the event of a LOCA (or a fuel-handling accident within the reactor building), this system recirculates the reactor building atmo­ sphere through high-efficiency filters and exhausts through an elevated vent. The reactor building pressure is thus maintained slightly negative with respect to ambi­ ent outdoor pressure. The FRVS removes at least 90% of particles 0.30 micron or larger in the building atmosphere and at least 90% of the elemental and methyl io­ dine with each pass through the filters. This system greatly reduces off-site doses, as discussed next. BWR LOCA Doses Like those for a PWR LOCA, BWR LOCA doses are usually calculated on the basis of two sets of assumptions. The assumptions that the NRC uses in Regulatory Guide 1.3 to analyze the radiological consequences of a LOCA in a BWR are not substantially different from those for the PWR. Thus, 25% of the iodine and 100% of the noble gas inventory are assumed to be released into TABLE 11.10 DOSES FROM LOCA IN 3,440-MW BWR EZB ('" 0.5 mi) LPZ Assumed release 2 hr, rems 30 Days, rems Regulatory Guide 1.3* Thyroid ::s 1 < I Whole body 1.25 < 1 Gap-plenum t Thyroid 0.00059 0.00088 Whole body 0.00007 0.0011 *Supplement No.3, Safety Evaluation Report for Hope Creek Generating Station, AEC Directorate of Licensing.

The resulting off-site doses are essentially the same as those calculated earlier for the PWR in the absence of the filtration, recirculation, and ventilation system. With the FRVS in operation, the off-site doses at the EZB and LPZ drop to the values shown in Table 11.10. Analysis by the General Electric Company indicates that only about 9% of the fuel rods would actually be perforated in a LOCA, and none of the fuel would melt. To be conservative, yet more realistic than Regulatory Guide 1.3, a BWR LOCA may be assumed to release into primary containment 25% of the fission product gases in the gap and plenum. The resulting doses for a 3,440-MW reactor are shown in the table. These doses are calculated on the assumption that the FRVS is 90% efficient. The HTGR Design Basis Design Accident (DBDA) Safety Systems. Generally speaking, a depressurization accident (the DBDA) in a HTGR is much less serious than a LOCA in a light-water reactor. For one thing, the high heat capacity of the large mass of graphite in the HTGR (about three million pounds in a 3,000-MW reactor) guarantees that the core temperature transients are slow and controllable. Furthennore, with the use of a single-phase gas coolant, a sudden reduction in system pressure cannot lead to a loss of all of the coolant or prevent its circulation because of a change in phase. The main cooling system of an HTGR consists of four (or six) separate loops, each with its own steam generator and steam-turbine-driven helium circulator. There is no single failure of an active component in the HTGR that will prevent the operation of enough of the main coolant loops to assure safe shutdown of the plant. Nevertheless, the HTGR is provided with a core auxiliary cooling system (CACS), which perfonns the same functions as the ECCS in a PWR or BWR. This CACS consists of two (or three) separate cooling loops, each containing a heat exchanger and an electrically driven circulator. A DBDA in an HTGR presumably would occur in the following way: upon the failure of a prestressed concrete reactor vessel penetrati on, the helium coolant would immediately begin to leave the vessel. To prevent too sudden an outrush of the gas, which might damage some of the reactor components, the flow area is restricted to 100 in2 or less by the design of the penetrati ons and by the addition of flow restrictors within the coolant loops. The reactor scrams on a low-pressure signal at about 10 sec, and the reactor power drops to decay heat levels about 35 sec later. By 100 sec from the time of the break, the helium flow has dropped to 4% of nonnal.

page number: 714
 text: 696 Reactor Licensing Chap. 11 Sufficient steam continues to be available from the main coolant system to operate the main circulators for approximately 12 min. After this time, the circu­ lators are driven by steam from low pressure (200 psig, 600°F) auxilia ry boilers, which normally supply the steam required for reactor startup, postshutdown heat removal, and heating of the reactor building. The CACS is actuated if, and only if, this secondary steam is unavailable. DBDA Doses An analysis of this incident shows that even with only two CACS loops operating, nowhere in the core does the temperature rise high enough to release fission products from the fuel. Thus, the only activity released into con­ tainment in a DBDA is the activity normally circulating with the coolant and ac­ tivity plated out of the coolant onto the walls of the coolant loops that is picked up by the escaping gas. The latter is known as liftoff activity and consists mostly of iodines and particulates containing isotopes of strontium and cesium. The activity in the circulating gas is mainly due to noble gases that have diffused out of the fuel particles. The total activity of these noble gases is comparable to that found in the gap and plenum of an LWR of the same power level; the iodine activity is 10 to 100 times smaller. HTGR plants are also equipped with a filter and a recirculation, and venti­ lation system. However, because of the small release of iodine in a DBDA and in order to protect the filters from the initially high containment temperature, this system is not started until about 2 hrs after an accident. The doses at the exclusion zone and LPZ boundaries are shown in Table 11.11. These are clearly well below 10 CFR 100 limits. Other LWR and HTGR Accidents Many other types of accidents in ad­ dition to the LOCA must be considered in the design and licensing of a nuclear power plant. Space permits only a brief description of a few of these. Some addi­ tional accidents are discussed in the problems at the end of the chapter.

 text: Sec. 11.7 Reactor Accidents 697 BWR: Steam Pipe Break The steam in a BWR plant is somewhat ra­ dioactive, since it is produced directly in the reactor. If a steam pipe should break anywhere outside of containment, the activity in the pipe escapes and quickly en­ ters the environment. To assure that steam flow into the broken pipe does not con­ tinue, each steam line in a BWR plant has at least two isolation valves that close automati cally with the decrease in pressure accompanying a break in the line. In analyzing this accident, it is assumed (Regulatory Guide 1.5) that (1) the isolation valves close in the maximum time characteri stic of the valves (about 10.5 sec); (2) all of the coolant in the broken steam line and its connecting lines at the time of the break, plus the steam passing through the valves prior to closure, is released; (3) the activity (including all the iodine and noble gases that may be present in the steam from leaking fuel rods) is released to the atmosphere within 2 hrs, at a height of 30 feet, under fumigation condition s. With these assumptions, the calculated thyroid doses for a 3,440-MW reactor at the EZB are on the order of 1 rem and somewhat lower at the LPZ. The whole-body doses are fractions of I mrem. BWR: Rod Drop It will be recalled that the control rods in a BWR enter from the bottom of the core and are inserted upwards. A number of failures in the control rod drive system of a BWR can be envisioned that could lead to the release of some activity into the containment. However, none is more serious than the uncoupling of a control rod from the drive mechanism when the rod is fully inserted in the reactor and the subsequent dropping of the rod out of the reactor. Although the mechanical design of the control rod prevents the rod from falling more rapidly than 5 ft/sec, the resulting increase in reactivity leads to a power transient, releasing approximately 4 x 109 joules of energy, for a reactor originally operating at 3,440 MW, before the transient is terminated by the negative Doppler coefficient of the fuel and the insertion of other rods. This energy release is estimated to perforate the cladding of about 1 % of the fuel rods ('"'-' 330 rods), and to release all of the fission product gases contained in the gap and plenum of these rods. All the noble gases are assumed to be transported to the steam dome at the top of the reactor vessel. However, most of the iodine isotopes remain behind in the water. The fission product gases in the dome are then carried by the steam down the steam lines, through the turbine, and into the condenser. The steam lines in a BWR plant are equipped with radiation monitors, and with the passing of the gases down the lines, these monitors trip the isolation valves, thus retaining the bulk of the fission product gases within containment. The gases reaching the condenser are assumed to be exhausted directly to the environment, although in normal operation the off-gas exhaust from the condenser is routed through time-delay holdup tanks and a filter system before exiting to the atmosphere.

page number: 716
 text: 698 Reactor Licensing Chap. 11 The overall doses from this incident are small. For a 3,440-MW plant, the EZB and LPZ thyroid doses are 0.019 rem and 0.037 rem, respectively. The corre­ sponding whole-body doses are 0.24 rem and 0.18 rem. PWR: Rod Ejection It is conceivable, although highly unlikely, that a failure of the control rod housing could occur in such a way that high-pressure reactor coolant water might forcibly eject a cluster control rod assembly. This would result in a power transient similar to that in a BWR rod drop accident. De­ tailed calculations show that this would lead to the failure of about 15% of the fuel rods with an attendant release into containment of the fission product gases from the gap and plenum of these rods. This is a far smaller release than in a LOCA, and the off-site doses are consequently also smaller. Fast-Reactor Accidents To date, only one experimental commercial fast reactor, the Fermi Reactor,22 has been built in the United States. Thus, there has been little experience with the licensing of fast reactors in this country, and the NRC has not yet developed formal guides for the evaluation of accidents. Studies of the LMFBR systems both here and abroad indicate, however, that the worst postulated accident for this type of reactor involves the meltdown and subsequent disruption of a portion of the core. This type of accident is often referred to as a core disruptive accident (CDA) or severe accident. A CDA can be initiated in several ways. Suppose, for example, that the flow of sodium into the core is partially blocked by some extraneous piece of metal that has become lodged at the bottom of the core. The sequence of events that follows such a blockage depends on many factors. The next scenario doubtless exaggerates the incident. First, those fuel rods in the core that are denied their normal cooling start to melt. This occurs about halfway up the core, at the point where the fuel temperature is initially the highest. The molten fuel then flows downward (and may solidify) in adjacent coolant channels. This, in tum, blocks the passage of sodium in these channels, causing the meltdown of additional fuel, which blocks other channels, and so on. This process continues until a portion of the core has been more or less eaten away as shown in Fig. ll.23(b). The situation at this point is that upwards of one-third of the core is left mo­ mentarily hanging above the remainder of the core. The reactor, of course, is sub­ critical. However, the unsupported part of the core now drops, and as the two parts come together, the multiplication factor rapidly increases. As soon as k goes above unity, energy is produced in the fuel. This release of energy tends to counter the momentum of the falling fuel and eventually the system blows apart. 22The Fermi Reactor was an LMFBR designed to operate at 300 MW. It went critical in 1963, suffered a partial meltdown in 1966, was repaired and returned to critical in 1970, only to be decom­ missioned soon thereafter for lack of operating funds.

Of course, the conditions within a fast reactor are not designed to optimize the explosive release of nuclear energy. Accordingly, the TNT equivalent of the CDA is much less than the yield of even a small nuclear bomb. With the Fermi Reactor, for instance, calculations showed that the worst postulated CDA would release the equivalent of about 700 lb (not tons) of TNT. Although this is not an insignificant amount of energy, the mass of that reactor, its pressure vessel, and its concrete shielding would have been more than adequate to contain such an energy release. In actual fact, the foregoing model of a CDA probably grossly overestimates the severity of the accident. For one thing, it appears unlikely that a small blockage, affecting only a few fuel channels and leading to the melting of a few fuel rods, will propagate over much of the core. Such a blockage did occur in the Fermi Reactor when pieces of zirconium broke off from a conical flow guide and became lodged at the base of the core. Coolant flow to two fuel assemblies, each containing 144 rods, was reduced, and portions of these assemblies were melted. However, very few neighboring rods were involved. 23 It is also unrealistic to assume that the whole of the upper portion of the core will remain in place while the center of the reactor melts out, especially if the reactor is large in diameter. Regions of the upper core can reasonably be expected to collapse as soon as the lower, supporting fuel, has melted. Such a gradual collapse considerably reduces the overall energy yield of a CDA. It may be mentioned that a flow blockage is not the only way in which a CDA might be initiated. This accident can result, for example, from the sudden ejection of a control rod when the reactor is operating at power, from the formation and passage of large sodium bubbles through the core, or from the breaking of a major coolant pipe-a bona fide LOCA. 23This may not have been a fair test, however, as the blockage occured at a low power-density region of the core and while the reactor was being brought up to power.

 text: 700 Reactor Licensing Chap. 11 Nonpower Accidents The previous discussions have centered on reactor accidents that involve operation of the reactor at power. Recent analysis of events suggests that scenarios involving accidents with the reactor shut down or accidents involving fuel handling are much more likely to occur. Accident risk analysis, which is discussed in the next section, suggests that low-power and shutdown accidents contribute significantly to the likelihood of core damage. In fact, analysis suggests that the contribution by such events to reactor core damage is equal to that of all other causes. When the reactor power level decreases to 10% or less of full power, the automatic actuation of safety systems is often disabled either by the hardware or procedur es. Thus, many normal safety systems that help to protect the reactor in the event of an accident are not easily available. The types of accidents that can occur at low power are similar to those at power. The typical accidents that are considered at shutdown or low power are as follows: loss of cooling, loss of coolant accidents, and reactivity events. The loss-of-cooling events occur when there is a loss of heat­ removal capability. At shutdown, the reactor is cooled using an auxiliary system, the residual heat-removal system, to remove the decay heat from the core. Loss of cooling can occur from a malfunction in this system or from a loss of electric power to drive the pumps in the residual heat removal system. LOCAs at low power are of concern for the same reason that they are at full power. At shutdown, the typicalloss-of-coolant event of concern is the drain down of the system. Since the system is usually depressurized at shutdown, pipe breaks are unlikely. A drain down can occur from the inadvertent opening of a valve or the interconnection of a system to the primary system. Reactivity events at shutdown can lead to a local or core-wide criticality. Examples of such events include the inadvertent removal of boron from the re­ actor coolant, an inadvertent control rod withdrawal, or refueling errors. Analy­ sis of such events suggest that these accidents could lead to large pressure peaks that would threaten the integrity of the piping system leading to a loss-of-coolant event. For PWR's, the most likely risk comes from the situation where the reactor vessel is partially drained. The lowered water level could lead to uncovering of the piping connection to the residual heat removal system. If this were to occur, then the accident would become a loss-of-cooling event. For a BWR, the most likely event is a cold-overpressurization event during filling of the system after refueling. Other possible shutdown accidents are fire and accidents involving fuel han­ dling. Fires can occur at anytime, but are particularly likely when maintenance of the system is being done, as during a shutdown. Fuel-handling accidents are of con­ cern, since the fuel in a reactor is off-loaded to the spent fuel storage pool during

Another possibility is an accident involving a criticality due to a mix-up in fuel types. While such events have not occurred at reactors, they have occurred in fuel-manufacturing facilities. The most recent event was the nuclear accident at the Tokai-Mura fuel-fabrication facility. Tokai-Mura Nuclear Accident The Tokai-Mura facility is operated by the Japan Nuclear Fuel Conversion Co. (JCO) , a subsidiary of Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. The facility is a fuel-manufacturing plant that converts enriched ura­ nium hexafluoride to uranium oxide in preparation for fuel fabrication. On September 30, 1999, three workers were preparing a small batch of fuel for the JOYO experimental fast breeder reactor, using uranium enriched to 18.8% 235U. It was JCO's first batch of fuel for that reactor in three years, and no proper qualification and training requirements appear to have been established to prepare the workers for the job. At around 10:35, when the volume of solution in the pre­ cipitation tank reached about 40 liters, containing about 16 kg U, a critical mass was reached. The resulting criticality exposed the workers and nearby residents to signifi­ cant doses of radiation. The three workers involved were exposed to doses of from 1,000 to 20,000 mSv, where 8,000 mSv is a lethal dose. Workers and residents re­ ceived doses of 10 to 50 mSv. No significant contamination escaped the facility. The dose was due to the radiation emitted during the criticality accident. The event occurred because the workers failed to follow proper procedures and lacked adequate safety training. The system was designed to preclude such an event, but various safety features were defeated by the workers. 11.8 ACCIDENT RISK ANALYSIS Nuclear power reactors, with their enormous inventories of fission products, obvi­ ously carry the potential for major accidents involving many people. Fortunately, there has been only one such accident to date-ChemobyI 24-and, as a result, it is not possible to fully evaluate the risk of this kind of accident as directly as, say, that of a fatal automobile accident, regarding which there is a superabundance of data. However, sophisticated methods of accident risk analysis, some of which were de­ veloped for the aerospace industry, have been applied to nuclear power plants in recent years. 24The accident at Three Mile Island did seriously damage the core, but did not result in a large release of radioactivity to the atmosphere.

 text: 702 Reactor Licensing Chap. 11 The Meaning of Risk "Risk" is a common word that may convey different meanings to different peo­ ple. For the purpose of making comparisons between different types of risks, the risk associated with a specified event is given the technical definition as the con­ sequence of the event per unit time. For example, there are on the order of 50,000 deaths from auto accidents per year in the United States. The total societal risk from such accidents is defined as 41,000 deaths/year. Because the US society contains approximately 270 million persons, the average individual risk is defined as 4.1 x 104 deaths/year 6 = 1.5 X 10-4 deaths/pers on-year. 270 x 10 persons The risk of an event can be computed in an obvious way from the frequency of the event and the magnitude of the consequences of the event: . { consequences} { events } RISk . . = frequency .. umt tIme umt tIme . { consequence} x magmtude event (11.102) In 1998, the number of automobile accidents in the US was about 6.3 million ac­ cidents per year, and one accident in 150 results in a fatality. The societal risk is therefore accidents 1 death deaths Risk = 6.3 x 106 x -----= 41,000 --, year 150 accidents year as given earlier. Table 11.12 presents some US accidental death statistics for the year 1969. It will be observed that the risk per person-year of accidental death ranges from about 10-4 (for automobiles and falls) to 10-7 (for lightning and storms). Except for certain hazardous occupations and sports, which involve a limited segment of the population, there are few if any activities engaged in by the general public that have associated risks as high as 10-3/person-year. Indeed, it appears that the public has developed a more or less consistent atti­ tude with regard to the more familiar risks. Evidently, risks as large as 10-3/person­ year are not acceptable. With a risk of 10-4/person-year, the public is willing to go to considerable trouble and expense to hold down the accident rate. Thus, various traffic programs are instituted: automobiles are required to be inspected; seat belts must be installed; fences and railings are placed at dangerous locations; money is spent on fire prevention and active fire control. Risks on the order of 10-5/person­ year are still acknowledged. Lifeguards are employed at swimming areas; special bottles with child-resi stant caps are used for drugs; and so on.

Accidents in this category tend to be viewed either as acts of God or as the indi­ vidual's own fault-as in "everybody knows you shouldn't stand under a tree in a thunder storm." It appears that the public finds a risk of 10-6/person-year or less in some sense acceptable -at least no cause for great concern. However, the public acceptability of a given risk depends not only on the size of the risk, but also on the magnitude of the consequences of the event. Consider, for example, two accidents A and B. A occurs on the average of once a year and there is one fatality. The societal risk of A is therefore one death per year. B, on the other hand, occurs only once in 10,000 years, but results in 10,000 deaths. The risk associated with B is also one death per year. Nevertheless, it appears that the public generally views accident B less favorably than accident A. Evidently, faced with the possibility of a disaster involving the loss of 10,000 lives, the public tends

page number: 722
 text: 704 Reactor Licensing Chap. 11 to ignore the low probability of the event and assumes that if it can happen it will happen. This attitude on the part of the public is known as risk aversion. Risk Determination The calculation of the risk associated with accidents in a nuclear power plant is a three-step process. First, it is necessary to determine the probabilities of the vari­ ous releases of radioactivity resulting from accidents at the plant. Second, the con­ sequences to the public of these releases must be evaluated. Finally, the release probabilities and their consequences are combined to obtain the overall risk. Because nuclear power plants are designed with carefully engineered safety features, some of which were discussed in Sections 11.3 and 11.7, the failure of a single plant component, in itself, cannot lead to a major release of radioactivity. Such a component failure sets in operation a sequence of safety systems intended to mitigate the effect of the failure. The ultimate release, if there is one, depends on the extent to which these safety systems perform their functions. Thus, any given initiating event can lead to a number of possible releases, each with its own probability. The identification of the accident sequences leading to various releases is facilitated by the use of event trees. This technique can best be understood by a simple illustrative example. Consider a large pipe break that leads to a LOCA. To develop the appropriate event tree, it is first necessary to determine which plant systems are likely to have an effect on the subsequent events. In this case, these are the station electric power, the emergency core cooling system, the radioactivity removal system (sprays, filters, etc.), and the containment system (the containment and its heat removal system). These systems and the initiating pipe break are then written in a sequence according to the time they can be expected to affect the course of the accident, as indicated at the top of Fig. 11.24. The event tree shown in the center of the figure consists of a series of branches for every possible sequence of events in which the indicated safety systems do or do not operate.25 According to the basic tree, the single initiating event can lead by way of 16 different paths to 16 different outcome s. The probability of any par­ ticular outcome is obtained by mUltiplying together the succession of probabilities along the appropriate branch. The computation is simplified by the fact that the probability of failure of any safety system is small, and so the probability that it succeeds is essentially unity. The probability of each outcome is indicated to the right of the corresponding branch. 25Partial operation of a safety system is not included. To be conservative, a partially operating system is assumed not to be operating at all.

 text: 706 Reactor Licensing Chap. 11 Because of the physical relationship between some reactor safety systems, the basic tree shown in the figure has a number of illogical branches. For instance, if all electric power fails at the plant, none of the other safety systems can operate and none of the growth from the lower branch of the basic tree is possible. The reduced event tree, pruned, so to speak, of its illogical branches, is shown at the bottom of Fig. 11.24. Once the event tree has been constructed, each outcome can be analyzed to determine how much radioactivity is released. This depends, in the case of a LOCA, on the extent of the meltdown of the fuel and on a number of other factors. The computation of the associated probability requires, as indicated in the figure, a knowledge of the failure probabilities of all the safety systems. The probabilities of initiating events, such as pipe breaks and vessel ruptures, can be otained from failure rate data on nuclear and other engineering systems. However, there is little data available on the failure rates of reactor safety systems. These are determined by the method of/ault tree analysis. A fault tree is essentially the reverse of an event tree. For a particular failure, the fault tree is used to identify the combinations and sequences of other failures that lead to the given failure. An example of this method is shown in Fig. 11.25, which gives a portion of the fault tree for the loss of all electrical power to the engineered safety features (ESFs). The operation of the ESFs requires both AC power, which provides the energy to run the pumps, fans, and so on, and DC power for the electrical systems that control the use of the AC power. Failure of either AC or DC power renders the ESFs inoperable. Hence, the fault tree in the figure starts at the first level with an "OR" gate, which is given the special symbol indica ted in the figure. If the probabilities of AC or DC power failures are PAC and PDC, respectively, then the probability PEP of the loss of all electrical power to the ESFs is essentially the sum PAC + PDC. Thus, if sufficient data are available on the failure of AC and DC power, the probability PEP can be computed directly. In the absence of such data, it is necessary to continue the tree to another level. For instance, there are two sources of AC power in the event of a LOCA­ off-site power supplied by power lines from the local power grid, and on-site power from standby diesel generators (and from a second reactor, if one is present). Be­ cause these power sources are independent of one another, both must fail to produce a loss of AC power, and accordingly they are coupled in Fig. 11.25 by an "AND" gate. If the probabilities of loss of on-site and off-site power are PNS and Pps, re­ spectively, then the probability of loss of all AC power PAC is clearly the product PNSPAC. If experimental failure rates for PNs or Pps are not known, additional l�v�ls would have to be added to the fault tree. In this way, the fault tree is continued

The result of this analysis is the probability PEP, which is the same as PB in the event tree in Fig. 11.24. With the calculation of possible accidental releases of radioactivity and their probabilities, the first step in the evaluation of nuclear risk is completed. The doses that would be received by the public are computed next, based on the population distribution in the vicinity of the plant and on prevailing weather conditions. These doses are then translated into acute fatalities and various nonfatal health effects, using dose-effect relationships similar to those discussed in Chapter 9. The prob­ abilities and the consequences are then combined using Eq. (11.102) to obtain the risks of nuclear plant accidents.

Chap. 11 The results of a comprehensive NRC study of nuclear accident risks are given in Table 11.13. These are based on the operation of 100 LWRs at 68 currently designated sites. As explained earlier, the societal risk is equal to the total number of people in the United States that can be expected to be affected by the operation of the reactors per year. The individual risk is the societal risk divided by the US population. Table 11.14 shows a comparison of societal and individual risk of acute fa­ talities from nuclear and nonnuclear accidents. Death from a nuclear accident is clearly a highly unlikely event. To place nuclear risks in further perspective, the NRC has also computed the frequency of nuclear accidents that would result in more than a given number of fatalities and has compared this with similar data on various man-caused and natural disasters. The results are given in Figs. 11.26 and 11.27, where the ordinate is the average number of events per year leading to more than N fatalities. It will be observed from the figures that the expected number of fatalities from nuclear accidents is orders of magnitude smaller than the number from common man-caused accidents and is on the order of the number of fatalities from meteors. It may also be noted that the possibility of large nuclear disasters- TABLE 11.14 RISK OF ACUTE FATALITIES FROM NUCLEAR AND NONNUCLEAR ACCIDENTS Societal risk, acute fatalities per year Nonnuclear 115,000 Nuclear 4 x 10-2 Individual risk, acute fatality per person-year Nonnuclear 6 x 10-4 Nuclear 2 x 10-10

This effluent is in either

page number: 729
 text: Sec. 11.9 Environmental Radiation Doses 711 gaseous or liquid form. However, the origin, amount, and composition of this ef­ fluent varies from plant to plant, even among plants using the same type of reactor. In a PWR plant, fission product gases released from leaking fuel rods and circulating in the primary loops are purged from the coolant in the chemical shim holdup tanks. These gases are then stored in decay tanks until their activity has decreased to a point where they can be released to the environment. In some PWR plants, however, the main source of gaseous radioactive effluent arises simply from the need to purge the atmosphere of the containment building prior to entering. Liq­ uid wastes originate in leaking valves, pumps, and other equipment. These wastes are collected in sumps within the reactor building and are also stored in decay tanks. The liquid is later diluted and discharged to a suitable body of water or so­ lidified and then drummed for off-site disposal. In a BWR plant, the most important source of gaseous radioactive effluent has traditionally been the main condenser. It will be recalled that the steam from the reactor, which in a BWR is radioactive, is condensed to water in the condenser after passing through the turbines. It can be shown that the efficiency of a steam cycle is highest when the condenser operates at as close to zero pressure as possible. With the condenser at zero pressure, some air inevitably leaks into it, and this must be continually exhausted. When the radioactive gases in the steam mix with the air leaking in, they are necessarily exhausted along with the air. To prevent this contamina ted air from escaping directly into the environment, it is pumped into hold-up tanks where the gases are permitted to decay for a period of time before being released to the atmosphere. Some of the newer BWR plants are also equipped with cryogenic systems that liquefy the condenser off-gas. The noble gases are then distilled off and stored for upwards of 60 days before being released. All of the noble gases, except 85Kr, have decayed by this time. Liquid wastes in the BWR originate in (and are handled in) essentially the same manner as those in the PWR. Regulation of Effluents In the United States, the authority for regulating effluent emissions from nuclear power plants rests with the NRC. However, such effluents, once they pass the site boundary, must meet rather complex standards established by the EPA and pub­ lished in 40 CFR 190.10. In an effort to assure that these EPA standards are not exceeded by any of the plants it regulates, the NRC has adopted the policy (10 CFR 50.34a) of "keeping levels of radioactive material in effluents to unrestricted areas as low as reasonably achievable." According to the NRC, the term "as low as reasonably achievable" means "as low as is reasonably achievable, taking into account the state of technology and the economics of improvements in relation to benefit to the public health and safety The NRC has translated its "as low as reasonably achievable" doctrine into the following numerical guides, applicable only to water cooled reactors, for the

 text: 712 Reactor Licensing Chap. 11 limitation of effluents from a single reactor:27 1. The annual release of radioactive material above background in liquid efflu­ ents shall not result in an annual dose or dose commitment to any individual in an unrestricted area in excess of 3 mrems to the total body or 10 mrems to any organ. 2. The annual release of radioactive material above background in gaseous ef­ fluents shall not result in an annual air dose (i.e., D to air) in an unrestricted area in excess of 10 mrads for y-rays and 20 mrads for fJ-rays. Larger re­ leases are pennitted, provided that the annual dose does not exceed 5 mrems to the total body or 15 mrems to the skin. 3. The annual release of radioactive iodine and radioactive material in particu­ late fonn shall not result in an annual dose or dose commitment to any organ in excess of 15 mrems. All releases of radioactivity from a nuclear power plant are carefully moni­ tored, and the NRC requires semiannual reporting of such releases from each li­ censee. The NRC, in turn, issues yearly reports summarizing release data. Figure 11.28 shows the average of the releases from 20 BWR and 133 PWR plants in the United States during the period from 1972 to 1978. Only one HTGR was in op­ eration at this time, and it is not included in the figure. As shown in Fig. 11.28, BWRs over the years have consistently emitted more radioactive gaseous effluents than PWRs. This has originated, as noted earlier, in the condenser off-gas. Pre­ sumably, newer methods of waste treatment, in particular the cryogenic separation previously referred to, will reduce this effluent in future BWRs. It will also be observed in Fig. 11.28 that both the BWR and PWR, especially the latter, release relatively copious amounts of 3H. This nuclide is produced di­ rectly in fission at the rate of approximately one atom per 10,000 fissions, and it is also fonned by the interaction of fast neutrons with lOB via the reaction (11.103) Tritium is a pure f3 -emitter, it is not conc entrated by biological species, and it passes fairly quickly through the human body. Its MPC values for air and water are therefore among the highest of any radionuclide. (See Table 9.16.) It is of some interest to mention that fossil fuel power plants, especially those burning coal, also emit radioactive effluents. The source of this activity is the fly ash discharged from such plants, which contains trace amounts of uranium and thorium and their decay products, primarily 226Ra and 228Th. The concentration of these nuclides in fly ash varies from one specimen of coal to another, but a typical 27Extracted from 10 CFR 50, Appendix 1.

 text: 714 Reactor Licensing Chap. 11 ash contains on the order of 3 pCi/g of each nuclide. All coal-burning plants have equipment for removing fly ash as it goes up the stack. This equipment usually has an efficiency of about 97.5%, so that about 2.5% of the fly ash is exhausted from the stack. A typical coal-burning plant may therefore emit as much as 5,000 tons of fly ash per year. The (MPC)a for the isotopes of radium and thorium are among the smallest for any radionuclide. This is because these elements have very long biological half-lives in the body (they are bone seekers) and decay by the emission of a-particles, whose quality factor is 10. The concentrations of these radionuclides in the atmosphere near a coal-burning plant can thus reach levels much higher, in tenns of (MPC)a, than those in the gaseous effluent of nuclear power plants. This is shown by the next example. Example 11.10 A 1 ,000-MWe plant operates at an efficiency of 38% on 13,000 Btullb coal with a 9% ash content. The plant stack is 100 m high. (a) Estimate the activity of 226Ra emitted from the plant. (b) Compare the maximum concentration of 226Ra at ground level under Pasquill F, 1 m/sec dispersion conditions with the (MPC)a for this nuclide of 3 x 10-12/LCi/cm3 Solution. 1. The thermal power of the plant is 1,000/0.38 = 2,632 MW. In 1 year, the energy released is 2,632 x 8,760 = 2.30 x 107 MW-hr. From Appendix I, 1 MW-hr = 3.412 x 106Btu, and so 2.30 x 107 x 3.412 X 106 Coal consumption = = 6.04 x 109 lb/yr 13,000 = 2.74 X 1012 g/yr. Because the coal is 97.5% ash and 2.5% of it escapes from the stack, Emitted ash = 0.09 x 0.025 x 2.74 x 1012 = 6.17 x 109g/hr. In one year, the plant emits the total activity 6.17 x 109 g x 3 X 10-12 Ci/g = 0.0185 Ci. [Ans.] 2. The maximum in Xv / Q' for a stack height of 100 m occurs at about 104 ffi. For a wind speed of 1 m/sec, X / Q' = 2.5 x 10-6 sec/m3 The value of Q' is 0.0185 Ci/3.16 x 107 = 5.85 X 10-10 Ci/sec. Thus, X = 5.85 X 10-10 x 2.5 X 10-6 = 1.46 X 10-15 Ci/m3 = 1.46 x 10-15 /LCi/cm3 While this is a factor of 3 x 10-12/1.46 X 10-15 = 2,050 times smaller than (MPC)a for 226Ra, the concentrations of radioactive gases emitted from a nOffi-

Doses from Effluents To evaluate the environmental impact of radioactive effluents from nuclear power plants, it is necessary to compute the doses received by the surrounding human population from these effluents.28 The computations are somewhat different for gaseous effluents emitted to the atmosphere and liquid wastes discharged to bodies of water, and these two cases will be considered separately. Gaseous Effluents As noted earlier, the gaseous effluent from nuclear power plants consists mostly of the noble gases and the isotopes of iodine. There are several routes by which these gases can enter into or otherwise interact with the human population. The principal exposure pathways are shown schematically in Fig. 11.29. As indicated in the figure, these gases, while in the atmosphere, give both a direct dose to the body and an internal dose from inhalation. The direct dose is largely due to the noble gases; the inhalation dose is mostly an iodine dose to the thyroid. Both of these doses can be computed in a straghtforward way from the formulas derived in Section 11.5. (See also Examples 11.2, 11.4, and 11.5.) The noble gases remain airborne at all times, and they do not enter into other exposure pathways. The iodine isotopes, however, gradually deposit out of the plume onto soil and vegetation. This activity provides a direct ground dose to persons nearby. Methods for computing this dose are discussed in the problems. In any event, this dose is usually smaller than that from other pathways. The deposition of the iodines carries these isotopes into the food chain. How­ ever, because of their short half-lives (the longest is that of 1311 and is only 8.04 days29) compared with the growing time of plants, very little activity enters the vegetation from the soil by way of the root system. Most of the iodine enters the food chain as the result of deposition on leafy vegetables and on forage grasses. A radiation dose is received directly when the vegetables are ingested and indirectly from the meat and dairy products ---especially milk-from grazing animals. To compute the radiation dose from ingested food, it is first necessary to de­ termine the equilibrium Iodine activity on the foliage. The rate Rd at which Iodine deposits from a cloud is proportional to its concentration in the cloud, so that (11.104) 2800ses to other animals in the vicinity of a nuclear plant must also be calculated, but only for the purpose of protecting the animal population as a whole, not individual animals. 29 A small amount of 1291 (T1/2 = 1.6 X 107 yr) is formed in and released from reactors. However, because of its long half-life, its activity is insignificant.

In this equation, Rd has units of Ci/m2-sec and X is in Cilm3 Thus, Vd has units of mlsec and is called the deposition velocity. Experiments show that Vd is approximately 0.01 mlsec. Because the emission of radioactive effluent is often stated in Ci/yr (or /1Ci/yr), it is convenient to rewrite Eq. (11.104) as (11.105) Here, Rd is in Ci/m2-yr, Q� is in Ci/yr, (X / Q') is the dilution factor in sec/m3, and Vd is in mlsec. Once the Iodine has fallen on the foliage, it may disappear, because of weath­ ering, or become diluted by new plant growth. It has been found that these are first-order decay processes, with a decay constant Af corresponding to a half-life of about 14 days. Therefore , if C f is the activity on the foliage at any time in Ci/m2, its total rate of disappearance is then (A + A f)C f' where A is the usual radioactive decay constant. In equilibrium, with the plume providing a constant deposition of

The proportionality factor has the value30 9.0 x 10-5 Ci/cm3 of milk per Ci/m2 of grass. Thus, the Iodine concentration in milk is (11.107) (11.108) The dose from this Iodine can be obtained most simply by comparing the pre­ ceding concentration with the general population MPC for water, as milk is mostly water and is ingested in the same way. It will be recalled from Chapter 9 that a continuous intake of 2,200 cm3/day of water containing a radionuc1ide at (MPC)w gives a dose rate, in equilibrium or after 50 yr, of 500 mrems/yr. An average per­ son, however, consumes less milk than water, namely, about 1,000 cm3/day. The (MPC)w is given in units of JLCi/cm3, so the dose rate from the continuous uptake of 1,000 cm3/day of milk containing iodine at the concentration C m JLCi/cm3 is Cm 1,000 227Cm if = ---- x --x 500 = ------- (M PC)w 2200 (M PC)wmrem/yr (11.109) It was noted earlier that the mass of an infant thyroid is one-tenth the mass of the adult thyroid. Because an infant consumes about as much milk as an adult, a given concentration of radioiodine will result in a dose to the infant thyroid about 10 times higher than to an adult thyroid. It follows, therefore, that . 2,270Cm Hinfant = mrem/yr. (MPC)w (11.110) 30This proportionality factor is highly variable, depending strongly on local feeding habits and on the time of year. The value given is a nominal, average value.

[Ans.] 3.0 x 10-7 Liquid Effluents There are several pathways by which man may become exposed to the radioactive waste discharged into bodies of water. For example, radioactive atoms may be absorbed directly if the body of water in question is used as a source of drinking water. The dose from this source can easily be computed by comparing the concentrations of the various radionuc1ides in the drinking water with the applicable (MPC)w. Exposure may also be obtained by persons swimming in or boating on the body of water. These doses are usually very small. A more important source of exposure is from the consumption of seafood.31 This exposure occurs by way of the complex food chain shown in simplified fonn in Fig. 11.30. Starting on the left in the figure, the radionuc1ides are absorbed or in­ gested by plankton. These are small plants (phytoplankton) and animals (zooplank- 31 The term "seafood" is used here to connote food originating in any body of water-oceans, rivers, lakes, etc.

These are eaten by fish, some of which, in tum, are eaten by other fish, by reptiles and amphibians, and by various macroin­ vertebrates, such as crabs, lobsters, and mollusks, all of which are consumed by man. Radionuclides are also absorbed from the water and the sediment by benthos, which are plants and animals that inhabit the bottoms of oceans, lakes, and rivers. These are eaten by fish and macroinvertebra tes, and some activity eventually finds its way to man. Activity absorbed by sediment also enters into macrophytes, larger plants, and passes to man via macroinvertebrate s. Finally, various waterfowl pick up activity directly from the water or from macrophyt es. The calculation of the radiation dose from contamina ted seafood is a four-step process. First, the concentration of the radionuclides discharged from the plant is estimated from the discharge rate and dispersion characteri stics of the receiving body of water. This part of the calculation is the most difficult and usually entails experimental and theoretical studies of the dilution of effluents in the particular body of water concerned.

 text: 720 Reactor Licensing Chap. 11 Second, the concentration of the radionuclides in seafood is computed. This computation is greatly simplified by the observation that the concentration Cs of any given radionuclide in a particular variety of seafood is directly proportional to the concentration C w of the radionuclide in the surrounding water. In equation form, this is (11.111) where the proporti onality constant C F is usually called the concentration factor and sometimes the bioaccumulation factor. Values of C F for several nuclides are given in Table 11.15 for different forms of seafood. It will be observed that C F in some cases is much greater than unity. This is in accordance with the well-known fact that certain elements (they need not be radioactive) are concentrated by aquatic life in passing up the food chain. Third, the consumption rate of seafood from waters near the power plant must be estimated. This is determined from statistical data on the eating habits of the local population. Fourth, because seafood is mostly water, the dose rate can be found by com­ paring the activity of the seafood Cs in tLCi/cm3 and its consumption rate Rs in cm3/day with the dose rate from the ingestion of water containing (MPC)w of the radionuclide in question. Since the (MPC)w gives a dose of 500 mrems/yr for a con­ tinuous intake of 2,200 cm3/day of water, the dose rate received from the seafood TABLE 11.15 NOMIN AL CONCE NTRATION FACTORS FOR AQUATIC ORGANISMS* Fresh water Salt water Element Fish Crustacea Mollusks Plants Fish Crustacea Mollusks Plants H K 4,400 16 12 8 13 Ca 70 350 1.9 40 16.5 10 Mn 81 125,000 300,000 150,000 363 2,270 22,080 5,230 Fe 191 930 25 ,170 6,675 1,800 2,000 7,600 2,260 Co 1,615 32,408 6,760 650 1,700 166 554 Zn 1,744 1,800 33,544 3,155 3,400 5,300 47,000 900 Sr 14 200 0.43 0.6 1.7 21 Zr-Nb 86 51 81 1,119 Ru 6.6 382.2 448 9 320 69 10 31 5,010 1,065 Cs 3,680 907 48 18 15 51 Ce 81 600 1,100 3,180 99 88 240 1,610 *Based on data from M.

Example 11.12 The maximum probable consumption rates of seafood from the (brackish) waters near a BWR plant are determined to be: fish, 110 g/day; mollusks, 10 g/day; and crustacea, 109/day. The plant discharges 0.197 /LCi of 59Fe per year, and the dilution factor at a point 30 ft from the exit pipe is 6.29 x 10-16 yr/cm3 The (MPC)w for 59Fe is 6 x 10-5 /LCi/cm3, based on exposure to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Estimate the yearly dose to the GI tract from seafood. Solution. The concentration of 59Fe 30 ft from the exit is Cw = 0.197 x 6.29 x 10-16 = 1.24 x 10-16/LCi/cm3 From Table 11.15, the saltwater concentration factor of fish for iron is 1,800. Then, from Eq. (11.111), the activity in the fish is Cs = 1800 x 1.24 x 10-16 = 2.23 X 10-13 /LCi/cm3 Finally, from Eq. (11.112), . 2.23 x 10-13 100 H = 6 X 10-5 x 2200 x 500 = 8.45 x 10-8mrems/yr. [Ans.] For mollusks, the dose rate is 3.57 x 10-8 mremlyr, and for crustaceans, it is 9.39 x 10-9 mrems/yr. The total dose from seafood is obtained by repeating this computation for all radionuc1ides in the liquid waste effluent. REFERENCES Licensing Joint Committee on Atomic Energy.
